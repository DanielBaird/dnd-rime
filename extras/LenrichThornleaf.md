**Lenrich Thornleaf** - halfling paladin, Lord Commander of the Order of the Silver Sun (a.k.a. the Blue Knights)


**Traits**

- politically adept
- fiercely devout
- scrupulously honest

Think the High Sparrow from GoT, but less creepy and no oath of poverty.


**Values**

- Honest, open governance (of an order, a city, a country...) becomes stable and keeps its citizens protected. And on the way to stability, it's okay to use force-of-arms to keep to the path.
- Everyone should want to do the Right Thing
- Lenrich is seldom wrong


**Quirk**

Lenrich had a brief rebellious period as a young halfling during which he roamed the forest for a while. He consequently has a level of Ranger. He and his wife Rosalyn have kept this 100% a secret from their sons.


**Relationships and bonds**

Father of Lucas and Linton. He expects his sons to continue his work, and insists to everyone, including himself, that Linton will surely soon realise that he serves the world better back at home.
