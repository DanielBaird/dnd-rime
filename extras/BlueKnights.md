Sigil: Silver and gold sun represented as a disc with eight rays

Common Name: The Blue Knights

Leader: Lord Commander Lenrich Thornleaf

Though only a couple of generations old, the Blue Knights have become the dominant political force in their home city of [some city with a significant halfling population] and have made some enemies both through their political rise in general, and in specific their resistance to bribes, corruption, and all the other standard techniques of smooth governance in the shadier areas of the Sword Coast.

They are led by a Lord Commander, currently Lenrich Thornleaf. Lenrich is the third person to hold the title, and is considerably less aggressively warlike than his predecessors, valuing a world where armed protection is less necessary and working to provide that, alongside the more traditional services expected of a paladin order.

A Blue Knight usually wears blue robes or (when armoured, which is often) a blue scapular, with a silver and gold sun represented as a disc with eight rays (the gold was added by the second Lord Commander, who said that a completely silver sun looked more like a big star than the sun).
