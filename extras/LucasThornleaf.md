A paladin of Arvoreen who holds the rank of Knight Protector in the Blue Knights, and the eldest and favored son on Lenrich Thornleaf, who is the third Lord Commander of the Order of the Silver Sun, commonly referred to as the Blue Knights.

Lucas was born into the order and buys in completely, expecting to continue his father's work within the The Order of the Silver Sun, perhaps even as Lord Commander some day.

Lucas has a brother Linton, who is a couple of years younger, less committed to the order, less comfortable with the yoke of duty, and certainly less inclined to avoid parental disappointment, to the point that he snuck out of [city] as soon as he had the resources and the chance, and hasn't been seen since.

Linton has sent occasional letters home reassuring his parents that he's fine, but not revealing his location. Lenrich has recently managed -- via some modest deduction and offering some less modest monetary rewards -- to deduce reasonably accurately his younger son's whereabouts, and sent Lucas to check up on Linton and plead either for his return, or at least for more regular and less cryptic communication. Lucas has since been tracking his brother from town to city, dive bar to dockside tavern.

While searching for Linton, Lucas often uses the alias "Finnegan", for perfectly normal reasons.
