We identify the real secret entrance on the map and make a note of it; then we go there and end up in the cultist fortress, in an giants-sized abandoned kitchen.

Out the door there's a dining room with a huge table. Rosk says this was used as an eating area and points out human sized furniture. There's some recent blood on the floor, and some more on the stairs going upwards in the corner of the dining room.

We open a door and find an elderly ice giant sitting on a big stool.

Lucas talks to him.
L: Hail, elder
G: My queen! is that you?
L: No, I am just a traveller
G: Then die!
...and we have to kill him.

Pilaf tries to convince him to stop attacking us by claiming we're part of the Auril alliance, but that's the wrong guess and he throws Pilaf against the wall.

After we kill the giant we open teh door ebehidn him and find a bunch of treasure, including ~2k golds-worth and an Alchemy Jug.

We find a wrecked amoury, the fortress door to the outside, and decide following the blood trail up the dining room stairs is the right move.

Upstairs the blood trail stops but no corpse.There's icicles hanging, a mastodon altar to the south, and a doorway to the north. There's noise coming through the doorway.

We open the door and see the old throne room.

Ice covers the floor; an armoured frost giant is fighting with the drow priestess we accidentally freed from the prison.

We think for a minute about our strategy and decide to just back away quietly and go look two floors down instead.

On the bottom floor, there's a huge walrus gamboling around on the ice. He comes over to talk to us and demands we answer his riddle: Do we have any fish?

We do have salt rations that is fish, but he doesn't like that at all and loses interest.

Rosk describes the area we're in. East and west are pairs of doors, leading to the Four Trials of Auril.

South is Auril's vault. North is the tomb of the frost giant queen. We wan tthe vault, but we can't go there without doing the trials of isolation, cruelty, endurance, and preservation.

We pick the endurance trial first, and get teleported to a nomad tribe camp. They gear up and head off ahead of us, we're supposed to out-hike them.

We chase after the nomads. It's cold and generally sucks. We're all suffering, and we pass some fallen nomads who didn't make it.

We finish the trial with a level of exhaustion each. Cruelty next.

We're teleported to a camp again, it's the bear tribe. The leader is standing near four bound tribesfolk lecturing the tribe about how the plan is to kill these four old folk and eat them.

Lucas hangs back, but Rosk is ready and snaps all four people's necks one after the other. That's enough for us to pass.

Next we try preservation. We teleport to the edge of a third camp; there has been a raid and there are half-frozen corpses strewn about.

A child is sobbing in a tent, Aryx the son of a wolf tribe chief. A rival wolf tribe has killed everyone except him.

We hear a guy calling Aryx's name, it's the Wolf King and we decide to kill this King guy. Once he's dead, a wolf appears and takes Aryx to a sister tribe.

Last trial is isolation. We're take to a tiger tribe camp; the tribe's queen heads off on a raid with her tribe, leaving us to guard the camp. It gets dark and we start to hear weird whispers that get louder and more insistent.

We resist the feelings of isolation for a while but Linton cracks and runs into the darkness, and Pilaf falls silent, not to speak again for a hundred hours.

This time once we return, we find Geluvicken the frost giant standing in the room, holding the head of the drow woman. They're grumpy.
