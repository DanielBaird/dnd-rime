Session 26

So we need a book and a map to crack open the glacier that hides the ancient magic city.

Duvessa agrees we can travel to Revel's End, escorting prisoners e.g. Prudence, and interrogate whoever we like in the prison.

Duvessa gifts us all some magic items -- boots for Linton, a sickle for Rosk, a pearl for Pilaf. (Nothing for Lucas but it's okay he gets some other boost).

We strategise for a while about how to get our prisoners to the jail without getting ambushed by their buddies.

We settle on:
- fake prison cart that leaves the day after us heading toward Termalaine, carrying fake prisoners but with real guards
- we take the real prisoners the day before, dressed as Bremen refugees including some or all of the five innkeeper brothers and with charity support from the Morninglord, looking for rebuild chances
- we stop in at Targos to meet Verlain's (Vellynne's) legal contact

We make it to Targos without apparent suspicion; Pilaf and Linton sneak in through the hole in the western wall to meet our contact.

Vellynne is there, and describes how we need to find the Book, by following prisoner Gantt's tips. Gantt once held political power in the Dale and be came across the info we need.

As it happens, our interests align with this third party -- and an enigmatic, elegant figure in a dapper suit enters the room.

Vellynne says "Perry Mason" here worked with Naerth's political rival Benson Hedges prior to Benson's arrest. Since then, Perry has worked to exonerate Benson and wants to travel to the prison to get him released. Perry can also arrange our audience with Gantt.

Meanwhile Rosk and Lucas manage to keep the convoy hidden, and eventually meet up with the others plus Perry, who's coming along with us.

We get to Bremen and decide to drop our disguise. Lucas summons an elk steed, "Proudhoof" before our long rest.

Soon after we leave Bremen we're caught in a blizzard. The cart horse spooks. Luckily Linton who's driving keeps shit under control and we settle in to wait out the blizzard.

Lucas swags down outside with Proudhoof, but the rest hunker into the cart.

Prudence wants to speak, but she just says her feet are cold so they re-gag her. Pilaf notices that Perry's notebook looks familiar. He says it was a gift years ago and it seems to never run out of paper.

That night Lucas cures Prue's frostbite but she tries to kick him and grabs at the keys. Lucas decides to care a bit less about Prue.

Next day we see a makeshift camp, and we try to avoid it. The camp packs up and follows us.

Lucas and Proudhoof head toward the travellers to ask what they want. It's dwarves.

The leader of Punky Bewster's Travelling Alcohol Service tells Lucas they need someone to pick the most delicious between their brews.

One brew: Danglewood Ale. Fuity, flavourful, leaves me with a happy feel.

Second brew: Cold-pressed Mud Mix. mud from teh underdark, full bodied, thick stout earthy, kinda like VB (in the sense of tasting like dirt). leaves a relaxed feel.

Third brew: Miner's Delight. includes an energy boost like red bull.  Feels invigorating.

Lucas bullshits his way through judgement but gives the tip to the daggarwood brew. The dwarves argue more about who's brew is best and Lucas rides back to the group.

That night we all have nightmares about vaguely etheral beings. Next day is uneventful, we expect to arrive tomorrow.

The next night Rosk catches a whiff of crag cats during his watch, so Pilaff is more alert and catches the attack when a crag cat kills our horse.

We quickly kill the crag cats -- Proudhoof takes out the second one -- but Perry ran off. Turns out he killed a crag cat of his own.

The enxt day Proudfoot takes over cart pulling duty and we get to Revel's End. It's a big tower next to a huge spike of rock. Perry answers the guard's calls and we're led into the prison.

We leave the cart and Proudhoof in teh yard and go into the prison to find Valish Gantt and Benson Hedges in their cells. Perry tells gaunt-looking Benson that he's getting out today.

We are toured past a bunch of other prisoners including a beautiful and powerful Drow woman with apparent frost powers; she charms Pilaf and Linton briefly.

We get to the warden's office, she's drunk. She thanks us for bringing the prisoners. Perry interrupts and says it's time to free Benson.

Perry heads out and we hear a commotion. We head to the roof of the inside guard tower; we find Perry there holding his dagger and his book. He intones "The eternal winter will give way to the endless darkness"

Lucas notes that the dagger is like the one the thorned devil held in the dragon assembly room.

Rosk charges at him and he falls off the tower to his death. The pool of blood around his body seeps toward the book, and when it touches the book we all feel the anti-magic field lift.
