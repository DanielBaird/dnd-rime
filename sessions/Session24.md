Session 24

We head toward BS.

Some of the refugees arent' gonna make it to Bryn Shander today but there's not much we can do about it.

We run into BS guards harassing refugees on the road. Linton pays them off to move on.

We get to BS and bluster through the gate guards who are processing refugees. One guard leads us to Duvessa and Markum at the town hall.

In the refugee crowds Linton is surprised by a pickpocket who escapes but with no coin.

We eventually get to Duvessa at Town Hall. It's super busy. Duvessa is happy to see us. We don't have much to share that she doesn't already know.

Looks like the deep gnome is working out at the Northlook. We plan to rush through BS toward Bremen, but the guard leading us to the gate takes us through some side streets and into a hidden ambush like a cowardly jerkface.

Lucas memorises the guard's face in case we don't kill him today. There's a drow assassin in the ambush and we focus on them a bit until they run away.

We kill the two guards and loot their bodies. The ambushing one is wearing a guards uniform with a stab hole that doesn't match his body.

We make it to the north gate and get through the smaller crowd of refugees who are trying to travel to Targos, against the advice of the gate guards. We blow through while telling everyone there that they shouldn't come to Targos coz there's about to be a dragon there.

At Targos we advise the gate guards of our arrival but keep on to Bremen.

Bremen's speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar is not great at organising so everything is chaotic. They're just evacuating with no defence plans.

We chip in and eventually get everyone to leave, including the recalcitrant five brothers. We stay long enough to see the dragon arrive, and Lucas tries a longshot with his new longbow before we run back to Targos.

We enter through T's one gate and find Maerth and Cpt. S? at the Luskan Arms. Maerth is a jerk who hasn't advised his population about the dragon and the need to evacuate. We decide to make a show of abandoning Targos.

We visit Keegan, Garret and Boy and convince them to evacuate. As they get away there's a big explosion in the direction of the docks. We don't see a dragon though, and as we arrive at the docks we realise there's a duergar attack and we wade in to a bunch of them.

Lucas gets charmed into hitting at Linton a few times but we eventually kill four duergar plus Durth, another one of Zardaroc's sons.
