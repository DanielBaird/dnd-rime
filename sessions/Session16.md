Session 16

We kill the tentacle creature.

Yk says "they've proven thenselves, and so I'll go with them to BS to negotiate. Izobai will be my regent."

Iz is talking to his retinue as we head off with Yk.

Some goblin children fanboi on Linton for a bit, him turning into a grey blobman when he died seemed to impress them.

We short rest and heal a bit, but we decide to leave the goblin fortress before anything else fucks us.

Everyone but Lucas dreams:

you're whipping over the tundra effortlessly, ignoring reindeer and hunting your prey. You approach a lookout facing away from you.

Standing over a sleeping figure you screech and attack

Pilaf takes a bunch of psychic damage and thunder step's away
We're all awake now from the screeching and thunder clap
Linton leaps up and punches the thing
Thing dashes off and disappears
Lucas Divine-sense's the thing's location
Pilaf scorches with fire
Lucas goes in for another hit
Shadow hits Linton
Another shadow appears and attacks Pilaf
We kill one and the other flees NW

Next morning, Pilaf and Linton who were hit by the shadows feel a pull, a call for help, from in the mountains (ESE). It feels like there's a sort of looping to it.

We try heading to BS but it's hard on Pilaf and Linton, so we summon the emergency battle mages and get them to escort the gnome to BS. They seem judgey, and leave Lucas with a Sending scroll that connects to their complaints dept.

We travel east, along the northern edges of the mountain range, and pass a riverside clearing used for fishing apparently by goliaths, but the cravings mean we can't stray much from the path we're on.

We come to a crevasse we need to follow south into the mountains, but we camp first.

Nothing unusual overnight, coz Lucas fails a perception save.

Next day we approach a glowing, gargantuan, tentacled mass. Pilaf thinks it's a kind of organic spaceship.

We notice a ballista on the tentacleship. Lucas, ahead, notices rustling in the snow nearby.

We approach the rustling, mostly because we don't want to be ambushed. It's two big maggotty things called Carrion Crawlers and we fight.

We kill one, the other runs back to the ship. Lucas is momentarily paralysed but not before he gets his middle finger bitten.

The ship tentacles are covered with numbing mucus.

We climb up to the first deck which has a ballista. The door inside is iced over. Rosk tries to wrench it open but eventually it's Lucas who opens it. Inside is a bunch of monsters.

We fight the dwarf/goblin/reindeer frankenstein creature for a bit while the gross facehuggers hide in the corner.

A gnome ceremorph comes downstairs and calls off the flesh golem. He converses with Pilaf at first in gnome, but switchs to mindspeak-common to address us all.

They're hunting exotic animals for research, and needs a psi crystal to fix the ship (not chardalyn). He gives us a metal detector box that will click near a psi crystal (5 mile range, clicks quicker the closer).

Linton gets the ceremorph to agree that we'll tip him off to where a dragon is for them to collect.
