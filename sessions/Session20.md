Session 20

There are some dark shapes out on the ice. We see a kid playing with bones who runs inside when they see us.

A suspicious guy comes out of that hovel (which has the town crest on the wall) and stares at us.

"We have no food or work, so be on your way."

Linton: We want assistance
"Why should I?"
L: For money?
"Money can't fix this."
L: We're looking for a guide

(the kid comes out and whispers to the guy)

"Oh where are my manners, please come in"
and we follow the guy into the hut. There's three rooms, one is his office and he sits in the only chair.

"I'm Edgra, speaker of Dougan's Hole. I've learned that outsiders are worth it."

We're looking for someone to guide us to the giant's circle.

"You probably want Yselm, she's weird and recently killed some travellers she claimed were bandits. She spends time in the forest like a weirdo"

Who's on the lake, what are they doing?

"Fisherfolk are fishing, idiot. What else would they be doing?"

Okay which house is Yselm's?

He tells us and we head that way, but hte kid runs after us. "Sorry about granddad... do you mind?" And he offers us a sketched picture of ourselves, for signing.

Lucas signs Linton's portrait "Linton Bignose"

We find Yselm's hut and Linton knocks. A blue eye peers out and asks what we want.

Linton: we wanna go to the giant's oracle
"Who sent you?"
L: Edgra

A tall older woman emerges with white hair and blue eyes. She's dressed in fur and has an air of power. She invites us in.

She knows of the giant circle but asks what we want it for. We struggle to convince her that us visiting the frost giants' sacred place is a good idea and she asks us to meet her tomorrow for her decision, at the stones of Thrune.

There's no inn so we hunt around for somewhere to camp overnight. Best we can think of is to head slightly out of town and camp.

We watch the lights of the fisherfolk on the lake until late, otherwise the night is uneventful.

She's already at the stones when we arrive, facing away with her hand on the stone.
Linton: Hey..?
She starts and turns to us.
"I have an answer. The land speaks to me and says to help you. So I'll take you there."

Yselm summons a huge white wolf called Regis and leads us off.

We travel west across the Dale that day. That night most folk (not Lucas) report seeing something following us. Yselm agrees, she doesn't know who. That night is uneventful.

Yselm says we'll be two more days travelling.

No-one notices our tail and we set up camp that night. Yselm describes that we're heading for a Jarlmoot, a spirit meeting of long-dead frost giant Jarls.

No events overnight.

Midday on the third day we cross a bridge and meet some bandits. Yselm and wolf are dealing with them when another assassin guy attacks from behind. Yselm gets hit in owl form, then healed by Lucas, and Rosk's goodberries.

That afternoon we find the flat topped hill of the Jarlmoot. There are seven icy giant-sized stone thrones in a circle.

It's a full moon so we're good to go tonight. Yselm scrapes ice away from runes to identify Reggaryarva's throne. We gotta defeat his champion to get access to his treasure vault.

We camp nearby and near midnight and we head to the hillock through sounds of ghostly whispers.

The Jarls appear. if you seek the wis of the FG, u must prove your worth. best my chanpion, he's tough y/n?

Pilaf: Y

the ground cracks open and a big FG skeleton climbs out.

We pound at each other for a bit and eventually kill the skeleton, and Reggie's throne grinds aside to reveal the treasure room's entrance.

Reggaryarva booms out: yer special book is in the fortress of grimscale on solstice island.

Yselm drops her furs and she's wearing Auril worshipper gear, and attacks us with her wolf, starting with a sleet storm. Lucas hits the wolf but then freezes to a popsicle.

She's doing pretty well against us but at some point she invokes Auril and at that point Reggie booms out "Enough!", everyone freezes in place, and walks over to Yselm.

He reprimands her for bring her shit into this holy place, and skeletal arms reach up and drag her into the ground. Reg sits down and he and the rest of the jarls disappear.

We rest a moment and head into the vault.

There's doors to a room, a gate to another space, and six braziers at the end of the room. The braziers are labelled Wyrm, Vind, Fjell, Dod, Krig, Liv.

Runes nearby say:
    Snatch a scale from a sleeping wyrm;
    Against the blowing wind, stand firm.
    Like a mountain's stone, strong and true;
    On little feet, death comes for you.
    Be the arrow that starts the war;
    Let life's blood fall till it falls no more.

In the door room there's a bunch of keys that Rosk brings down, and they open chests containing:
- An elven arrow
- A dead snowy owl, frozen stiff
- A gleaming scale from a young white dragon
- A fist-sized stone from Kelvin's Cairn

We add some drips of blood and blow some air, and all the braziers are lit one by one. The gate opens and we follow the path down to another room.

A silver chest has a gold key in its lock but Rosk switches it for a silver key we found. It holds a lion-headed Horn of Blasting.

We camp at the Jarlmoot overnight. We all have nightmares of something tirelessly searching the Dale.

We head to BS but on the way there we see someone approaching. We turn aside but a blizzard starts up and we lose sight of them.

We overnight in the blizzard, with a poorly constructed camp and wake with exhaustion. That day we're approached by a druid in hawk form, who lands and summons the Emergency Mages. They inform us that we're required in Easthaven by the Council of Speakers, and teleport us there immediately.
