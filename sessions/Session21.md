Session 21

We arrive at Easthaven, there's some smoke rising from houses here and there but whatever the event was, it's finished, and people are mostly calm and working to recover.

We find Imdra in conversation with Daneth and some town officials, and Verlain with some more mages.

Linton: Hey Daneth, catch us up

We head into Daneth's office with Imdra.

We imprisoned a duergar we caught trying to get back to the boat we cleared out. They never spoke to us but more duergar showed up and started setting fires. We caught some and learned that the first guy we caught was some important figure they'd come to save, and also there's an impending danger coming for us.

Linton volunteers to interrogate the first prisoner so we head down to the sub basement interrogation room.

Linton: "wanna tell us about this imminent danger?"
- lol fuck you

Lucas: "we'll just kill you when the thing kicks off, why not play along?"
- lol fuck you

Pilaf: "Hey buddy can't we all get along?"
- yeah let's work together. You start destroying the town right now, and once the seige engine arrives maybe we'll let you join us

We bail on this jerk

Verlaine is talkinng with other mages about someone "I don't care what his notivation was, he was a member of the brotherhood"

The other mages are rude jerks but Verlaine is interested in our info about the seige engine. They were talking about D'zaan. We tell her about the Spire of Netherill and the sim who turned into a real boy.

Verlaine says she'll chase the book, so we can head for the duergar base. We ask about chardalyn but she agrees it probably powers the duergar Big Thing.

It's early afternoon so we head south to where we think the duergar base is.

We struggle to keep track but eventually get to the southern moutain range. That night Linton sees creatures creeping toward the camp.

It's duregar and we fight. Lucas gets spelled to hit Linton. We kill a couple leaving a sneaky one behind a tree. When we get to that guy we realise it's the guy we were interrogating in Easthaven, and we kill him too.

We head into the mountains and notice a crag cat tracking us. Pilaf leaves some food for the cat and we don't see it again.

We finally crest a hill and see the mountains proper, with a wall of mountain filled with arrowslits. This is Zardaroc's fortress. There's the sound of those living here, and a staircase leads up.

At the top of the stairs Rosk spiders through the nearby arrow slit and opens the door and a portcullis behind. We meet up in a corridor inside, along with a dueregar who raises the alarm. A bunch of d emerge and there's a big fight.

Next room has a table and a map of the ten towns. A model dragon is rigged to travel along a groove in the table, and when Lucas pulls a handle the dragon grinds across the landscape visiting each town in turn. There's a rough timeline as well. We write it all down.

Next room is a fancy betroom and Lucas takes a lovely jeweled smoking jacket.

A scroll reads:
1-3-6 2-5-2 9-7-5 4-3-4
8-2-7 5-6-3 7-1-4 2-9-9

We trigger a gas trap but escape with a beard comb, Lucas' new jacket, and a pair of obsidian sandals.

We head down a corridor and find a portcullis beyond which we see down a deep vertical tunnel into a huge workspace in which a chardalyn dragon is being assembled/carved.

We decide to head down right away, but before we can a door bangs open and we see an unconscious d with a few others standing around.

A old d crone eating unnamed meat invites us in.
