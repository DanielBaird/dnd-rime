Session 8

We go chat to Atennis at Frozenfar Expeditions. He's an aging human, chatting with Jarthra.

Atennis was once a ranger scout, now a coordinator of adventures. He thanked us for returning his carved perl beads.

He can't identify the crystals, seems familiar though. Maybe show some "scholars" in Easthaven or Bryn Shander.

He hasn't heard of any ruined wizard towers locally but remembers stories of a pirate ship. Lucas promises Atennis a 50/50 split on any pirate treasure.

We track Long-shanks down and head out east to the secret tower.

That night Linton notices a chingwa but it runs off.

Next day a blizzard; we hunker down and wait it out.

Second night Pilaf notices a gaunt looking wolf approaching the camp; she digs out some jerky and offers it to the beast, who eats and leaves.

Third day, Long-shanks is casting about to find the right trail but finds the way okay. Eventually we approach an outcropping of ice and rock; closer we see it's a 20 foot tall stone spur that Long-shanks identifies as magically created.

We circumnavigate it and find a tunnel descending into the ground alongside the spur of rock.

Lucas slides down the tunnel on his shield. It's fun and dumps him onto the ceiling of an upside down room.



upside down room!
crost everwhere
door flush with ceiling
statues from ceiling; long faced wizardy humans in robes with staffs. Sconces opposite have upside down fire lighting the room.

Linton arrives in a rumpled heap; he rolls into a pushup and springs up. Lucas offers a secret Thornleaf Boys fist bump that he returns perfectly.

The rest of the group arrive at varying levels of elegance, Long-shanks knocking himself unconscious as he comes (Pilaf gave him a bit of a shove in response to some casual Drow racism).

The door's ajar; the taller characters can see a corridor beyond. At the far end is an upside down staircase, blocked by ice and rubble.

We clamber through the upside down door and head through a northern side door into an upside down workshop, it's tables smashed when they fell as hte tower flipped?

We find an iron key.

An adjacent room has glass shards and a locked chest attached to the ceiling (once floor). Linton and Rosk climb to unlock the chest as Lucas and Pilaf hold a cloak to catch the contents.

A bunch of potions spill out -- 4 potions of resistance to something (each different).

South from the corridor is a library type room, ruined books everwhere and another broken table. A tunnel leads down.

Lucas finds a book called "Magical Wonders of Netheril". This book is a collection of interviews with Netherese archmages, who discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and the creation of mythallars. The book includes sketches of such devices.

Lucas gets Rosk to drop him into the hole. This room held two cages, one holding a human-sized insectoid corpse.

We all struggle to climb down and there are some injuries.

East door leads to a blocked stairwell; north door leads to another room with rubble and books; Lucas finds "Unfettered ---" but turns out it's The Unfettered Mind. This lunatic text discusses how one might exist solely as a disembodied brain, preserved for eons in a magical suspension fluid. It includes sketches of brains in jars.

Lucas pushes into the remaining room. It's a magical sound-removing room, Lucas likes it a lot and we fuck around with the silent room a bit.

This time we tied a proper rope to prepare to descend into the wizard lab, full of ruined lab equipment and ruined shelving. As we tumble awkwardly down, an zombie opens a door and peers at us for a second.

A few seconds later an attractive young wizard strolls into the room and introduces himself as D'zaan. We ask how he got through being burned at the stake. He admits that he's a simulacrum of D'zaan investigating this tower, part of a flying Netherese city that crashed ages ago.

He introduces the zombie as Crintas, his wight bodyguard.

We're not sure how much to trust this clone wizard
but he's probably no immediate threat. Linton investigates the upsidedown ceiling altar, and finds a flask of blue that Pilaf catches as it falls and -- perhaps irresponsibly -- immediately drinks the whole thing. It gives her Minor Illusion.
