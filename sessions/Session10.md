Session 10

The bell tolls and we decide to find it. A blizzard starts and intensifies with each step north.

The bell continues and it's volume increases as we come closer. A booming voice calls out "A PACT HAS BEEN STRUCK".

The howling blizzard increases, our eyes scrunch shut, and suddenly it stops, and when we open our eyes we are back in the Rune Chamber, in a pile, with no snow on us.

Dzaan and Crintas are there, they're heading for the door (apparently it's been a minute or so since we disappeared). We all explain outselves; Dzaan basically has gotten what he wants and doesn't care about us any more.

Nothing to do but leave, but as we make our way up through the buried tower, we run into a group of goblins. It's tense for a minute but eventually we're properly talking, and their leader is someone we know -- the goblin with the eagle familiar that we let live, who's name is Izobai.

Izobai takes a moment to kill a couple of goblins in his group, then with tghe loyalists dispatched and only his rebels remaining, asks us to help overthrow the current goblin chief Yarb-Gnock, ruler of Karkolohk, a secret goblin city inside caves far to the south west.

Yarb-Gnock had revolutionised gobin lives during his rule, improving living conditions and civility in the goblin world, but the Rime has made things tougher and Yarb-Gnock's civil systems have been collasping. Izobai wants to reverse the situation and go back to the "natural" goblin nature of looting and savagery.

We agree, make a bunch of plans that Bryan agreed we can do "flashbacks" later to invent, and make out way out to the Dale and travel west to Caer Konig. Linton's chingwa is back. At Caer Konig we greet Atennis at Frozen Far Expeditions; when we tell him that Longshanks was killed by goblins, he remembers hearing that someone in Bryn Shander's local government was negotiating with goblins.

We stay overnight with Allie(?) and Cori(?) at the Northern Light Inn and on the way south the next morning, we pass Torvus, still guarding the town by apparently hiding in snow drifts and drinking until he passes out.

We head to Caer Dineval. We meet two folk in the way into town; once they see us clearly, they pause and approach carefully. Someone called Hethyl had told them to go collect us from the path. They're vague about the details but we agree to come along.

They lead us to the Caer Dineval castle. It has stout doors and town flags flying. There are two guards at the gate who let us through; they whisper to each other as we pass.

The castle courtyard is cross-crossed with footprints but empty of folk. We're led to the keep and head through into the hall. There's a tiefling cleaning dishes, and another tiefling burst into the hall and demands info from our guides about why we're here. They explain that it's at Hethyl's request but that seems unsatisfying.

We notice that everyone we've met have been wearing crystal amulets made out of the same kind of crystals we found in the duergar base.

We're led up some stairs to sparse room with a truly ancient dwarf in a rocking chair. This is Hethyl. She sends our two guides away.

She's silent for a bit and sits looking like she's about to die; Lucas stokes the fire up. Eventually she speaks. "I've forseen my doom and the doom of this world, but there is one path forward."

She's the soothsayer of a cult who "serve a higher purpose" and they oppose Auril. Her job is to have visions and stopping Auril is what's required to stop the fall of the world.

We ask about the crystals:
The crystals are a symbol of the power they serve. The crystal material itself doesn't serve a particular magical purpose.

We ask about our role in the action:
There are many parts for us to play, but she has forseen the rise of a duergar warlord Xardok who plans to conquor the Dale, and their fortress includes a forge powered by the heart of a red dragon and he plans to destroy the Ten Towns of the Dale.

He's powerful and dangerous, but we are not yet ready to face him.

Then she dies, the fire extnguishes, and we're alone in the room. Lucas writes down everything he can remember:
"
Xardorok Sunblight, a duergar warlord, will conquer Icewind Dale unless the characters defeat him.
Xardorok has a fortress on the surface, hidden in the Spine of the World. It contains, among other things, a forge powered by the still-beating heart of a red dragon.
Xardorok has a plan for the systematic destruction of Ten-Towns, which the characters can discover if they search his fortress.
The characters will die if they face Xardorok too soon. They must test their mettle against the horrors that haunt the farthest reaches of Icewind Dale before they can hope to survive the perils of Xardorok's fortress.
"

We open the door and call our guides back. Then the cranky tiefling from before charges in, sees Hethyl is dead, and says "Finally!". Then he turns to us and says "Right, you lot can fuck off now."

We agree to go real soon and Cadroth storms off. Lucas closes the door behind him and talk some more to the guide.

- wow he's a cranky shit
Cadroth is a bit like that, but he gets the job done. He never agreed much with Hethyl, who said he wasn't suited to the "Purpose" but was an acceptable leader.

- anything else we should know?
He hands a crystal to Pilaf for use as a password.

We're done here and head off south through the town (accompanied by occasional glances and whispers) and head toward East Haven.

That night on the trail Lucas gets attacked on watch by a Crag Cat. It flattens him to the ground.

Linton hears the commotion and leaps to punch the cat. Lucas pushes the cat's paw aside, climbs to his feet, and smashes the cat with his hammer.

Rosk kicks Pilaf awake and blasts a Chill Touch at the cat, but a second Crag Cat screams "Vengence!" and jumps onto Pilaf.

Linton finishes off the first cat and runs over to the new talking one; so does Lucas. Our next few attacks don't loosen its bite on Pilaf's head until a great hit from Linton, then some Thunderwaves and a hammer pound finally knocks it out.

Lucas ties the cat up, heals it enough to wake it up, and tries to negotiate a truce. The cat isn't particularly articulate and eventually Lucas gives up and wanders off, feeling like he failed to protect the cat. Linton understands the situation and mercifully pounds the cat into slime.

We've not had enough rest but continue to East Haven anyway. As we arrive we hear the town's alarm bell ringing.
