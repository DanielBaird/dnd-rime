Session 12

We're tired from the duregar fight and decide to overnight at the White Lady Inn. Bartleban isn't super welcoming but we update him about our exploits and ask for a room.

Rolando arrives and does his seance spruiking again. We line up with a few other guests.

- "Lady who rises from the lake, come to us in our darkest hour, etc"
- Rising chill, candles blow out, etc
- "Lady is present! Reach out with your minds!"
- Once again Pilaf rolls the best persuasion
- "Tell us about Levistus!"
- DEVIL
- "Do you serve Levistus?"
- NO
- "Did Levistus kill your husband?"
- NO
- ...and then she fades away

We sleep overnight and wake refreshed. The next morning, we're met by Imdra who's talking to Bartleban. They have extracted info about the cauldron and we head up to the Town Hall to talk with the speaker, Daneth.

He's pretty shaken by his interactions with Prudence and informs us the cauldron is being taken to Targos; Prue expected payment on arrival.

He acknowledges the cauldron is highly valuable and we're owed a debt already, but requests that we attempt to recover the cauldron. He doesn't have much to offer us immediately, but agrees to lease us two of the town's docks for 199 years starting today; dock managment to be run by the town on our behalf until we want to assume control. So that's a nice retirement plan for us.

We decide to pursue the cauldron down the Eastway to Targos. The first night we spend halfway to Bryn Shander. Rosk dozes off during his watch, and we all awaken around midday in a mysteriously featureless snow field. Rosk spies a building in the distance.

We head toward the building and find a sinister looking black lodge on wooden stilts, on a ridge above a gorge. Icy steps climb to the door; it's boarded up and looks abandoned. Snow covers the nearby wood shed and outhouse.

We climb the stairs carefully and quietly. Linton slowly opens the front door. It smells like burnt wood, flesh, and quicklime.

There's snow coming through holes in the roof; a table with the charred remains of a book sits in the centre of the room, a scorched skeleton is near the table, and a round object on the floor. Linton enters and encounters a big floating head with fire for eyes, watching us and muttering about yet more adventurers coming to loot the place.

Rosk pokes around the skeleton and finds an Amulet of Health. He pockets it and approaches the floating head.

"Yo floating head thing, how's it going?"
- You can see me?? You're the first people I've met since the accident

"We're here to stop the Rime."
- That device down there next to my body is supposed to help stop it. Not sure what went wrong but you can see the results. Minor setback, I'm planning to fix it.

"How long have you been here?"
- It's hard to tell

"That's your book?"

- Yes that's my book, shame it was full of great ideas. My name's Macreadus. I miss Copper Knobberknocker my rock gnome friend, hopefully they come back and help out. He's usually in the House of the Morninglord in Bryn Shander, and brings me shipments of provisions back I needed when I was alive and studying in this cabin.

But that aside, you can see me so let's sort this out. The device has a flaw; the rings it uses can't contain the energy it puts out. We need another ring to make it work. I sure it will give us the ability to control the weather and end the Rime.

Somebody grab the thing and we'll get it going.

Lucas kept chatting to Macredus as the group gets the stuff ready.

"Any plans to handle the Frost Maiden for when she notices this device changing her weather plans?"

- Nope

"Any idea how we got transported here?"

- What do you mean? You came to my door.

Linton picks up the device, clumsily. It explodes and vaporises everyone with radiant damage...

...and we wake up back in our camp that night. Phew!

The rest of the trip is uneventful, and we get to Bryn Shander at dusk, making our way to the Northlook. We scanned the taproom and located Danika; meanwhile a group of people see Pilaf, then get up and leave.

Danica is estatic that we've brought her a real live chingwa, and we get the promised 25gp plus a 25gp bonus, plus we get to keep the magic detector lamp. She spends some time observing and making notes but doesn't need to keep the chingwa; Linton decides to keep it around for a bit.

Scramsax is excited to hear our stories and we drink for free for a few hours. He says the group who left earlier were rough-n-tumble out of towners, otherwise there's not much news. He tells us that the House of the Morninglord is a temple (converted from older residences) to some lame sun god.

We retire to a couple of rooms. As is apparently tradition, folk sneak in to attack us during the night. Linton wakes up and charges out the door to attack, but fumbles his door operations and alerts the assassins.

There's three people in the hall, all of whom were in the group from the tavern room. Linton punches the nearest guy, and Lucas springs up and sets that guy on fire with a bunch of paladin bullshit, who spends the next turn frantically patting the fire out.

The group leader is discombobulated enough that he misses Pilaf a few times in a row, coughing on Rosk's spores.

Linton kills the crispy one and rolls on to the other lackey, who screams "No! Dave!" as Linton pounds him. He madly swings his mace at Linton, connecting twice and bringing Linton close to death.

- Pilaf acids the big guy
- Rosk moonbeams the big guy
- Lucas hammers little guy (John, apparently Dave's partner)
- The big guy, still in moonbeam, hits Pilaf and runs
- Linton kills little guy
- Pilaf chases big guy, and fires a scorching ray
- Rosk thorns the hallway
- Lucas runs through the thorns to stop the guy escaping
- Guy runs into an empty room
- linton punches him
- Pilaf acids him into unconsciousness

We interrogate and he's an opportunistic slaver who was trying to collect us, particularly Pilaf and Rosk, as exotic slaves.
