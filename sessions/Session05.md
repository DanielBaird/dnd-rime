Linton claims to be really Linton, cursed by the ice goddess.

Lucas can't quite accept this but puts his dagger away.

we find:
3 x 10gp emeralds
50 sp
Hat of Vermin
Rope of Mending

On the way back out Lucas blurts out "What the fuck did you do, I was only a month behind and you managed to get cursed." then he defers the answer.

Linton turns into Rosk briefly, demonstrating his transform powers

We decide to collect the cauldron, which is a Cauldron of Plenty. While we're lowering it down the big ice wall, we notice our chingwa latern is glowing.

Rosk turns into a spider and scouts ahead. Lucas tries to tie off the rope and climbs down, but the rope loosens and he falls to the ice, cracking the ice wall, which sprays forth water.

Pilaf tries to ray of Frost a way down, but the water spray turns into a serpent-like elemental and attacks Pilaf.

Rosk summons a moonbeam

Lucas climbs the cliff again

Water creature wraps Pilaf in water to drown her

Lucas pulls her out

Linton beats the water elemental to death

We drag the cauldron back to the boat and travel back to easthaven. We try the Town Hall and assistant to the town Speaker, Prudence

Prue's interested in the cauldron but doesn't care that much, and says Imdra is at the White Lady

We go to the White Lady Inn

Ronaldo a halfling is idly playing a fiddle in the corner

Imdra is at the bar chatting with an elderly barkeep. We catch the tail end of the convo -- "yeah it's supposed to taste funny, it's gnome"

Imdra agrees that we can have the wizard's bag, and she'd give it to us at the town hall tomorrow morning

We demo the cauldron and she suggests we can trade it to the speaker tomorrow

We decide to stay the night and Bartaban(?) the innkeep serves us bad ale and food. Ronaldo chats with us. He tells us about the white lady... she was married to a miser who kept his money in a locked chest. she died young, mysteriously; one night while widower was out on the lake (with his gold) his late wife appeared and his boat capscised. The boat and gold were swalled into the lake. the lade appears on still nights, said to lead travellers to the sunken treasure, So, do you guys wanna do a seance?

We sure do, we enter a back room filled with incense, candles, and silks hanging from rafters. Some inn guests are here, looking awkward about sitting cross legged on the floor

once we sit down in the circle, Ronaldo starts the seance. "Lady who watches from the lake, come to us and tell us what you've seen, etc etc"

after a bit the windows frost up, the candles flicker out, Ronaldo asks us all to "reach out" to the spirit. he points to Linton and aske him for a message for the lady

Linton: "What up?" ...no response
Lucas: "Greaaaaaat Laaaaady! Bleeess us with your knowledge of the wooooorld beyooond!!" ...no response
Pilaf: " Hey we're super friendly, please come out!" ...Ronaldo says "her presene grows stronger"
Rosk: "Give us a siiiign, hit me baby one more time"
Pilaf again: "Alriht lady we're waiting to welcome you"

the remaining candles extinguish, and the words "I am here" are scrawled into the window frost behind Ronaldo. "I sense her presence! White lady, tell is where is your husband's treasure??"

None of his questions get any response

Pilaf: "I'm sorry you died, how'd it happen?"

the word "FROST" appears in the window

Pilaf: "The frost maiden? frost BITE?" ..no response
Pilaf: "Where's the treasure?"
LAKE
"Where in the lake? maybe a map?"
...

Pilaf: "is there anything else you want tell us?"
DANGER

..and the room warms up slightly, and she's gone.

We allocate the two rooms Pilaf + Lucas one, Rosh + Linton the other (Lucas seemed reluctant to share with Linton).

During the night Pilaf awakes to see "Levistus" scrawled in the window frost.

In the morning, Lucas points out that Levistus is an Arch Devil that rules the 5th level of Hell

At breakfast, Lucas Divine Sense, but doesn't detect any altars or fiends.

We meet Imdra who delivers the hopefully magical bag. It's a rusty coloured bag.

We head inside to talk to Speaker Waylen, he knows about the cauldron, let's demo. Danneth Weylen is a respectably attired human with a humble smallish office. We leave the cauldron with Linton as the rest of us troop into the office.

While Lucas is doing a sales pitch, Linton meets Prudence in the hall. She disappears again when she realises the speaker is busy.

We negotiate for a total sale of 5 x 500gp gems plus the wizard's copper tube; for tube plus 3 gems now and the remaining two gems in 30 days.

As we leave Prudence shows up asking for five good soldiers, which Imdra nominates.

These folk turn up and escort the cauldron away.
