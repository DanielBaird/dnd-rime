We overnight in Bremen at one of the five taverns, and spend some time chatting to Tali.

Next morning we head out to Angajuk's Bell and get to the coast that day, search about a bit, and find the dock.

There's a cabin made from stone with barnacles on the door timbers. A frozen pier with a rowboat frozen in place alongside. A small island just offshore nearby has another dock with a bell on it.

Lucas tries as shoulder charge through the frozen door, which doesn't budge, until Linton helps out and Lucas and Linton break through (Lucas taking a  little damage).

The cabin is just a plain single bed with a big pile of ancient firewood. Scratchings indicate the last occupant was hundreds of years ago.

Proudhoof stays behind onshore while the rest of us scramble across the ice to the second dock. The bell is mysteriously not frozen over. We all climb up onto the dock.

Linton rings the bell. It's super echo-y but nothing special happens. The rest of us take turns ringing the bell.

A minute or two later a dolphin pokes its head out of the pool.

Some guys come out from hiding and thank us for summoning the whale, they want to capture and butcher the whale and they weren't able to summon it.

We talk a bit but they're set on catching and probably butchering the whale, so we fight. As they dodge Lucas' Bruning Hands they yell out to be careful of the exploding barrels.

We beat the shit out of them a little and they surrender. Our condition of acceptance is that they have to leave the area for today.

They head off and a whale appears with a sort of wood nest on its back. We explain that we're looking for an island to seek answers. The whale knows the island but isn't convinced that taking us there to die is a good idea.

We explain we are working on stopping the Rime and our mission takes us there, and the whale agrees. It invites us aboard its head boat.

It warns up to hold our breath and dives. An air bubble forms around the boat hat, Angajuk chuckles at us all holding our breaths.

We re-surface every 90 mins or so and spend a few minutes in fresh air; the fourth time we resurface it is night, and it feels super extra cold. Angajuk says we'll dive again asap. Rosk notices the source of the aurora in the distance appears to be approaching us.

We dive again. A few cycles further forward and we're approaching the island, and notice an increasing number of shipwrecks.

Eventually we surface in the freezing cold with a solid wall of mist ahead of us. Angajuk says it'll get worse from now and we spend a few minutes enjoying what sunlight filters down on us.

Next surface is in heavy fog. Cliffs and a bunch of shipwrecks are ahead. A dock made of ice is dimly visible; we realise it's giant-sized. It's super incredibly cold.

We disembark at the dock; Angajuk says they'll hang around for 24 hours then assume we're dead.

We clamber up the giant steps and eventually we're met with an icy expanse, a few ice statues around. Lucas walks past the third statue as Linton passes the first; one statue moves and says something suddenly; It might be saying "Welcome!" in Ice Giant.

- No habla ice giant

"Welcome to the island of solstice. How pleasant it is to have visitors. My name Soppo, at your service."

- hello, it's a bit cold

"It you first time here yes? Soppo not remember see you before."

- sure. Any idea where we could find a library or a book store?

Soppo doesn't know what those things are but insists on guiding us around the island. They're an Ice Mephit.

Soppo describes that they've been here for hundreds of years and sounds bored, and eager to show us around. They head up the path, expecting us to follow.

- we'll avoid the dangerous areas right?

"Everywhere same danger. Soppo not afraid of anywhere."

"Soppo have no visitors long time. Last visitor arrive cold and wet. Frost Maiden took her before much talk. Soppo could not help visitor. But we will see her on the path!"

- Back when there were lots of visitors, what was this island like?

Soppo describes a bustling, active, frost giant settlement.

- tell us about the frost giant enmpire.
We get a tirade of historial info about the old fortress, once a queen's castle

- who lives here now?
Soppo doesn't know. Somebody? Soppo avoids the castle now.

We walk along after Soppo and find a field of frozen various beasts and creatures. They're all super accurate, Lucas assumes they're real things magically frozen into ice sculpture. Soppo says fields of these have appeared across the island.

We keep going through the valley. Something seems familiar to Rosk but he can't work out what.

Soppo announces that the last visitor is ahead. They dust off a frozen lump in the snow; it's the corpse of Mary, the woman we saved from the Duergar prison and then lost in a subsequent avalanche.

When we touch her a white ferret leaps out from the snow. It scurries up Linton's arm onto his shoulder. Linton decides to call it Cinnamon.

We find a spell book on her, but Soppo confirms that she didn't arrive with her bag that we remember she cared a lot about. Maybe it's on her wrecked ship?

We keep on and eventually arrive at a cave. Soppo says he can't come in but we're supposed to go visit the ladies inside.

Lucas lights up his hammer and jogs into the fairly staight tunnel yelling "Tunnel!". It's cold, kind of different from outside -- the chill is deep in our bones.

Eventually we get to a door with incomprehensible writing. Lucas pushes it open. The room beyond is large, dimly lit with mysterious light, and only a cauldron on the far side. The cauldron contents glow. There are three figures standing around the cauldron.

They're weirdly still and non-reactive. Lucas suspects an illusion trap.

Rosk approaches. They're all very old looking women; left to right, one is covering her eyes, one has eyes and mouth sewn shut, one is covering her eyes with her fists and has her mouth sewn shut.

We approach close enough to see into the cauldron. There's a wispy, churning silver stuff in there switching between shapes. While we're looking, the right crone's hands open to reveal eyeballs held in her hands.

The middle crone moves as if addressing us, but the voice comes from the third. They tell us that they expected us, and give us a prophecy.

> The frigid wasteland whispers cold,
A tapestry of stories old,
Beware the mirage, through fables spun,
For truths and lies may be as one.

> A secret lies beneath the frost,
In chilling winds, its power embossed,
Many hearts crave its might,
But none so far have seen the light.

> But, amidst the darkness, a flicker gleams,
A spark of hope, a beacon it seems,
Yet those who dares trust their heart,
May find themselves torn apart.

> So heed this prophecy, heed it well,
In frozen land where whispers dwell,
A challenge waits which you must brave,
Hope it not your early grave.

> Now journey forth with wary eyes,
In this realm where intrigue lies,
Embrace the challenge, face your doom,
To find the answers of winter's gloom.
