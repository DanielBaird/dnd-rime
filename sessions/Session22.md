Session 22

A old duergar crone eating unnamed meat invites us in, it's Grandolpha Muzgardt.

She has a shiny mechanical mini dragon.

Lucas: what's with the big dragon downstairs?

- Who are you?

us: We're from the ten humanoid towns, we'd quite like to prevent the big dragon downstairs from destroying the towns.

- I'm married to Zardaroc as a business plan, but I don't support his dragon plan. Not all duergar support his slightly crazy sounding plans and maybe he's gone too far into the religious fanaticism. Maybe we should switch to a trade arrangement with the towns instead of killing them?

We plan to go and challenge Zardoc to try and provoke a one-on-four challenge. Grandolpha says to go ahead down the corridor and she'll catch up.

Rosk hears some arguing but we head the other way to an elevator room. After a few minutes a few duergar show up and we all crowd into a lift.

The bottom lift room includes a Duergar Hammerer in a weird painful looking exoskeleton running the elevator machinery.

The next room includes a statue with it's head replaced with a brazier. A creature is chained to the bottom of the statue; it's a mind flayer with its tentacles cut off, parts of its brain drilled out, and fucked up in various other ways. This is kind of a fun nativity scene thing for Deep Duerra's religion.

We're led into the big Forge area, filled with duergar guards, the big chardalyn dragon, and some

Zardaroc lecturers us for a bit; we do a bit of shittalking. It goes back and forth a bit and eventually he decides to "demonstrate" how cool he is.

He grows big and we start fighting. He goes down surprisingly soon and we're faced with his offsiders, who try to turn the dragon on -- but not in a sexy way.

The cloaked guy pulls out a weird dagger and Lucas tackles him to the ground. Sadly that's the wrong guy and the other duergar on the dragon platform blows a horn and the dragon comes to life.

We pile on the dragon, which is still in restraints, pounding at it.

The dragon blasts at the horn guy and smudges them out. The crunched up hood guy turns onto a spiky demon guy who looks like a Big Problem. They go and smash up a dragon restraint.

The dragon breaks free, the flailing chain hitting the devil. It flies out of the cave via a vertical shaft. The devil takes Lucas out just before dying.

Rosk resurrects Lucas and we regroup, engaging with the remaining duregar.

Grandolpha shows up and we debrief. She has no idea how to stop the dragon but offers sleds and rations to get us after the dragon.

We're hailed by one of the duergar's prisoners, a caged human woman. She seems happy to have her equipment returned, particularly something she checks for in her bag.
