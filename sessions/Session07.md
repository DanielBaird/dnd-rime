Session 7

We find a small room with a desk, holding a scroll, some crystals (cheap tinted glass and three big shards of an unfamiliar crystal material), a coin purse (23gp and 7 silver) and the stolen lantern.

Then we go south and find a lockup; in the prison cells there are five Spore Servants, a kind of mushroom zombie.

West to a storeroom with sleeping cells adjacent. Mostly supplies, blankets etc. 25 pearl beads (one of the items reported stolen); also crafter's tools, potion of healing.

The other door from the main hall is some empty rooms with fighting equipment; an open trapdoor in one room probably leads to the bunker.

Rosk climbs into the tunnel and emerges in the bunker.

We run into the mysterious dwarf again on the way out. He translates the note:

Brother,
You will find me on the frozen ferry in Easthaven. From this new base, the search for chardalyn continues. Long may our father reign over this dark land!
Durth

He thinks maybe the three crystals are Easthaven related. He thinks we should talk to his partner Atennis at Frozen Far Expeditions about the crystals and the note.

Lucas asks about Garet, and the dwarf thinks for a second and decides to bring us back to his camp for chats. The camp's in the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.

His name is Jarthra Farzassh. Atennis is letting the younger guides like Jarthra take over the work at Far Frozen.

Garet's clients were a Goliath, a Tiefling, and a Halfling; they stayed overnight in town and got supplies from FF. J doesn't remember much else about them but does recall the expected path they planned to follow up the Cairn.

We sleep the night at the base camp, stow the goats using a PETA-approved method, and head up the Cairn.

Big Rock & Goats: we see some mountain goats bleating in a mocking tone. The halflings struggle to jump to the next handhold and fall, taking damage.

Avalanche: J yells "avalanche!" and runs up the path to try and avoid it. Rosh turns into a goat and springs away; the rest of us try to keep up with J -- this works for Lucas but not Linton and Pilaf. Pilaf gets banged around a bit but Linton has fully vanished under the snow.

Lucas guesses where Linton is and rushes to his guess; he's exhausetd by the time we eventually dig him out.

Rosk heals Pilaf her avalanche damage.

Garet: We find an unconscious humanoid; Lucas rushes to heal him. Boy is super excite -- it's Garet.

Garet thinks Keegan worries too much but has to acknowledge that in this case it's saved his life. He doesn't know what the group was after but they were attacked by a yeti. The yeti seems to lose interest so the group might still be alive.

As he's telling us this, we're attacked by a Crag Cat. There's a bit of face biting and suddenly make that two Crag Cats, the second one flattens Lucas to the ground when it appears.

We kill the first, and Pilaf drives off the second with a shower of sparks.

Jarthra says that Crag Cats hunt in family groups and we probably won't see many more. At Garet's urging we continue up the Cairn, searching for Garet's group.

Around the area Garet was attacked by the yeti, we find a cave mouth. Makingo(?) the goliath fought the yeti, maybe he headed into the cave?

We go into the cave. There's a room to the left with a ledge around a deep pit; the right path shows blood and drag marks.

There are heads frozen into the wall; one is a goliath head, another matches the description of the ore-carrying dwarf Ooblek(?) we didn't find on our first adventure.

We find a tyke Yeti playing with a living halfling; the tyke withdraws behind the giant mother yeti and they watch as Rosk carefully collects the halfling and we back slowly out -- right into the dad yeti.

Moonbeams and hammer hits hurt the dad yeti, but he hypnotises Linton with some kind of cold power and he lapses into inaction.

The moonbeam's continuing damage finally kills the yeti.

We continue up the mountain and come to a crevasse; at the bottom there's a ruined camp -- tent and stuff buried in snow, a pair of boots poking out a a drift,and the tiefling sitting nearby. She doesn't respond to our hails and when we approach we realise she's dead and frozen.

Rosk pulls the boots (and the dwarf corpse attached) out of the snow. J recognises Barthoon(?)'s headless body -- an amateur explorer.

Perilou the halfling describes how she squired for Makingo the goliath, but now she's giving up adventuring.

We drag out asses back to Caer Koenig and the Northern Light Inn. We give Allie her lantern and hand her the rest of our loot, to be returned to the original owners.

There's another mysterious human stranger in the bar; Lucas dubbs them Long-shanks.

They remind us about the Easthaven evil wizard; he hired people to find a buried tower, and killed them to keep the secret, but one of them told this guy the location. They propose we share the loot and we negotiate over the split; we agree he can keep the worst 70% of the treasure.
