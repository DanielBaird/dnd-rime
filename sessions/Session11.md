Session 11

Alarms bells in East Haven. We head toward the Town Hall, occasionally meeting a guard running or a civilian locking their doors and windows.

We get the Town Hall and find Imdra organising guards into squads. She's planning an expedition.

When she sees us she ushers us into the town hall. It's been raided -- speaker Daneth's office door is broken in. He's sitting describing the raid to a couple of guards.

Imdra tells us that the cauldron we left here had been stolen in a break in. The Speaker's office door is broken but no signs indicating how they got into the building itself.

Daneth says he was working late, heard a commotion in the foyer, and found the guards knocked out, Prudence missing, and the cauldron gone from the room it was in.

At least three hooded figures were dragging the cauldron out to a carpet they'd brought (presumeably to handle it quietly), but when they saw Daneth they bustled him into his office and barricaded him in. He's worried they took Prudence as a hostage.

We cast about and pick up suspicious tracks of a giant-like creature with companions, and find it diverging from the road and travelling parallel for a while.

We follow the tracks through dusk and into the night, Rosk continuing to track with the help of light cantrips. We eventually find a camp with two sleeping humanoid figures (and no giants or cauldrons). Their fire has gone out and they're apparently both asleep.

Rosk scouts around to see if the giant tracks continue past this camp, but can't find the trail. He tries to sneak to the camp but kicks snow onto the sleeping figures and they spring up.

"Who goes there?" calls Prudence's voice.

"We're friends, here to rescue you!" calls Rosk.

Then the fight starts. The thug travelling with Prudence rushes to attack, trading blows with Rosk, Linton and Lucas.

- prue shoots rosk with crossbow
- thug hits lucas
- linton knocks thug out
- rosk and linton chase prue
- prue runs away
- Pilaf drops her with a few scorching rays
- in interrogation she's cavalier and uninformative
- she is cheerfully confident that we can't catch up with the axebeak

We can't catch the trail again so we tie her up and spend the night here.

Next day we drag her back to town. Daneth and Imdra both struggle to believe that Prudence stole the cauldron.

We decide to investigate the frozen ferry / duergar situation. We ask about Chardalyn, mentioned in the duergar note from session 7.

Daneth explains that chardalyn is the name for that native crystal stuff we've been coming across.

We head to the ferry and go aboard. The one cabin has four bedrolls and a table with a rolled up parchment map of the Dale, with the ten towns marked, plus marks where the Cairn base is, and another mark in the southern mountains. We guess that this is Xardorok's fortress.

We're attacked by an invisible duergar from a corner of the room. He has weird suggestion powers that convince Lucas to Searing Smite on Rosk, but in the end we knock him out.

- interrogate
- hes upset that we cleard out the cairn
- fighting outside
- lucas tries to take Dursk outside as a hostage but he shrinks to a rat-size and disappears
- pilaf runs outside and scorches three duergar who are fighting with the guards outside
- linton leaps down on one and kills him
- the guards kill the others

We report to Daneth. He translates our map; the Cairn base is labelled "Nildar", the southern base is labelled "home".
