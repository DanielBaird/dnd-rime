We try to work out the magic bag. Linton pulls out a baby goat; Lucas pulls out an angry owl. We decide to work it out later.

The copper tube contains a scroll with incomprehensible writing that moves as you try to see it. We decide to work this out later too.

We travel north to Caer-Dineval, a nine hour trip with no blizzards.

Approaching C-D, which is a one-road town, the main road leading from a huge ruined castle at the peak of a lakeside mountain down to the docks. The castle was the ancient seat of control for the Dale.

As we approach, the elemental-detecting lantern glows.

We hear a person yelling, and soon find a woman yelling random stuff at her house. We approach, she's yelling about windows being opened, things being moved, etc. Sounds like chingwa to us...

Lucas hails the woman, who is suspicious of us. Lucas explains that we're hunting elemental pranksters and it sounds like she has some around. She's weird and heads back into the house, but as she does we hear a window dink open on the side of the house.

We check it out and find tiny tracks leading from the window to nearby trees. Rosk pursues, following the tracks into the thicket but losing the trail. We hear noises somewhere nearby.

Linton picks up noises in some shrubs and points Rosk that way. Rosk picks up the trail and follows it to a clearing with three hay-clad chingwa sitting asround a kind of tea party setup made of stolen cutlery.

Linton pulls out some cutlery and food, and a chingwa pulls him over to the tea party, encouraging him to play. He shares his rations around. This is working great and the chingwa start tugging on Linton's clothes and poking his equipment.

One chingwa makes special friends with Linton, so we head into town hoping that the chingwa will follow.

The town is weirdly empty for early evening, and we don't see a single person anywhere. We stump up the curving road and knock on the door of an inn that's the last building before the castle. There's a pot of simmering chowder and a single person inside, the human barkeep. They're a bit weird and say they don't have any rooms.

We order food but the price is 5 gold per bowl so we skip it, fuck this place, and head to Caer-Konig. There's no disturbance to our travel and we get to C-K in the mid evening.

CK is some buildings around the small bay, and an outer ring of buildings higher on the ridge around the bay.

Where the road enters CK past the wrectage of the old tower, there's a big building with an iron fence. A pile of snow alongside the fence gate shakes and a dragonborn bursts out, stinking of ale and raving about thieves.

Torvus the town speaker realises we aren't thieves, and introduces himself. He slurs out that there's thieves in town, they stole the magical lantern from the Northern Light Inn the other night. Cori, presumably the innkeep as the NLI, won't let him be part of the investigation. He has a bunch of other stories and not much more.

The inn is mostly empty; the young woman behind the bar smiles at Torvus and calls for some hot food for him.

Allie says hello. Linton explains that we're looking for Garet, and found this dragonborn on the way in.  She doesn't know Garet but tells us that there's been lots of thieving in the last few days -- her lantern, a bunch of goats from Glenn who owns a tavern, gems from the Frozen Far... Allie thinks it's dwarves.

A human woman, Cori, comes through from the kitchen with soup for Torvus. "No dwarf did this... there's something more here, what use would hungry dwarves have for a lantern?"

The lantern was a fancy decoration, no real use aside from pretty colours. Allie and Cori argue about who is the cleverest sister.

Lucas tries the bag again and pulls out a softball sized hunk of fur and meat; he shoves it back in and decides to sort it out later.

Pilaf and Rosk study our scroll and Pilaf determines that it's a scroll of Fireball.

We sleep the night at the Northern Light Inn, and fail perception checks.

The next morning Allie is talking to someone, with urgency. The person is Glenn, who has been robbed of two more goats. Glen reports no sign of tracks. We toop over the Glen's "Hook Line and Sinker" tavern and he shows us the broken window latch into the room he overnights his goats in.

Rosk finds tracks from the window and we follow them for a few minutes, they lead out of town to a new wet of tracks, a drag line from a sled or something. We follow the drag line to the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.

We lose the tracks but meet a dwarf who tells us about a duergar camp ahead and how to get there. He confirms that the duergar use an ogre to drag their sleds around.

We follow his directions and find a fortress-like stronghold buried into the cliff face. The main entrance is a large double door; there's a separate bunker nearby.

A barred covert used to spill water down the slope, now frozen solid.

Rosk scouts the waterway as an actic rabbit, but can't get past a rope up to a wellhead.

We decide on a frontal assault. Lucas opens the doors to find a pit and raised drawbridge behind. Linton and Rosk leap the pit, Rosk in giant spider mode, as crossbow bolts rain down on us from the bunker.

We fight a duergar and an undead ogre; Lucas eventually Turns the ogre once he realises its a zombie.

We pile up against a door, but two more duergar bust in through another. Most of us run to the fight, leaving Pilaf by the first door to deal with the sudden arrival of a third duergar.

While Rosk and Linton keep the first two busy, Lucas runs back across the room to help Pilaf. The third duergar turns invisible when he sees his two comrades die, leaving us with the undead ogre. Lucas heals Pilaf.

Rosk tosses some fire at the ogre, intending to lure it toward the group, but Linton charges in to pound it, perhaps trying to prove to Lucas that he's a real halfling. The ogre's morning star smashes Linton into the ground, turning him back into an unconscious, blobby, grey, decidedly un-halfling humanoid.  The ogre lurches toward the rest of us. Lucas destroys the ogre with a divinely powered hammer smite; Rosk summons goodberries to revive Linton.

There's still an invisible duergar to account for, but otherwise we're out of danger.
