Session 19

We've destroyed the altar and the beserkers fell over dead.

This is an old dwarven mining cave that was then a nomad camp. Lucas goes looking for chardalyn on the Auril beserkers but there's nothing interesting.

We overnight at the cave then head back to Termalaine. It's weirdly even darker than we expect, and we find the corpse of a beserker, perished in the cold when his protection evaporated.

We notice a bright light to the south, but the day gets darker as the southern light approaches us. We bravely approach it as the day darkens everywhere else around us.

Eventually we see a hooded figure in the distance, apparently centered in the brightness. Rosk has bad feelings about this creature and recommends we avoid.

The entity is the source of the light and it approaches us, bringing with it howling wind and storm. The wind speaks -- This is the doom that awaits you all. This is the doom etc etc.

It pull out a jagged sword and summons pillars of ice from the ground that come to life and charge at us as ice mephits.

Lucas fights the main guy and goes to 0. This seems to be the guy's main goal. The rest of the gang finish him off that round and everyone cleans up the mephits.

We short-rest then head to the Blue Clam in Termalaine, enjoy a free dinner, and overlight at the Eastside. Doora ajar overnight?

Next day we head south to Bryn Shander, passing a group on the road who are weirdly ill-equipped for the cold.

We get to BS during the sacrifice-to-Auril ceremony. The Northlook is closed so we head to the town centre where everyone is attending the winner-dies lottery draw. The winner is one of the sacrifice protesters and there's a kerfuffle between guards and the sacrifice.

We wait it out with varying levels of tolerance, and head to the House of the Morninglord, finding Copper in his rooms working on something. We show him the remnants of the machine and explain that Macreedus killed himself confirming Copper's theory that it needed a third protection ring. We got it working but we couldn't keep it working.

Rosk asks if Copper knows where to get more crystals like this. He says they're rare and he got this one from a trader.

He's sad that Macreedus didn't trust him with the third protection ring idea. We ask to keep the crystal and he reluctantly agrees to sell it back to us for a few gold.

We reflect on the stuff we still have to do.

- Grey Lady ghost and devil
- goblin situation
- duergar base
- mind flayer alien ship wants our crystal

We stop in at Town Hall to see how the goblin negotiations are going. We find some guards and some people shackled to the horse rail outside. These are the lottery protesters.

Inside the lotter winner is chained up arguing with Markum. We find Duvessa in her office. We talk about goblins (no offers have been made yet and they're working out how to use Fake Goblin King), and the sacrifice protesters. Duvessa asks about our encounters with Auril and her vassals, and Verlain the magic woman listens in.

Scramsax at the Northlook is happy to hear our stories and offers free room and board. Late that night Scramsax knocks on Lucas and Linton's door, there's someone asking for us.

We all troop downstairs; our visitor is Verlain. She talks about the Arcane Brotherhood and how they're searching for arcane relics and locations. She notes we've already encountered D'zaan. She's after the city that the tower of netheril came from.

SHe tells us about a book (the Codecil of Auril(?)) with an incatation, the Rime of the Frost Maiden, that can split the glacier where the city lies.

Circle of giant thrones?
giants go there for oracle consults
someone at dougan's hole knows the way there

We lock up the pub and head back to bed.

Next morning we decide to deliver the alien crystal first, then visit Dougan's Hole. We head through the town markets to the south gate, and find some slaver/traders selling kobold and goblins.

Lucas can't walk by and ends up buying all the kobolds and sending them to the House of the Morninglord, and the dark gnome and sending it to Scramsax to work as a night manager.

Finally we make it through the gate and head out to the Dale.

Travel is nice enough and after a few days we get to the nautiloid ship. We climb aboard and knock; after a minute Dredivex invites us in.

We present the shattered crystal. His face drops -- this isn't going to help. He says he'll have to shutter the ship and head into town with the family to try and constuct a beacon or something.

We can't do anything else here, so we decide to follow the river east to Dougan's Hole. The days pass easily enough and we arrive.

DH is the smallest and most insular of the towns. There's some deformities and whatnot apparently from the inbreeding. The frozen lake has stopped the boats.

There's a ring of magaliths south of the town, the Twenty Stones of Thrune. Thrune might be a god or an ancient elemental spirit.
