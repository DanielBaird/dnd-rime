Session 14

We all want to fuck over Naerth, but we can't think of a good way to do it, so we decide to head back to Bryn Shander and see how the goblin stuff is going.

When we arrive, the BS gate guards are even more sullen and demand to search us. We're over shit like this are everyone's spoiling for a fight.

Rosk proposes walking around to the other gate, and we're okay with that so we head that way, and make it in without issue.

Let's leave the guards attitude festering for a bit and head to House of the Morninglord to talk to Cobberknocker the gnome who supplied Macreadus (the floating skull ghost who was working on a solution to the Rime).

We find the local abbot, an older human woman who looks like she was previously an adventurer, giving a sermon to a group of Morninglord worshippers. We listen in.

After the sermon the abbot, Mishann, comes over to chat. Linton asks for a Morninglord pamphlet, and also asks after Kobberknocker.

She invites us to future services, and introduces us to Copper who's a rock gnome wearing some kind of teddy bear onesie (actually fluffy cold weather gear). Linton offers to assist with clearing away the service's chairs, and awkwardly Copper just watches him do it.

We fill Copper in on our Macredus "dream", and he's interested but not convinced that M's dead. Macredus was independently working on a rime solution and Copper dropping supplies was a side job. He says we can do the next supply run to check it out. The cottage is north-west of Kelvin's Cairn (we get a map).

On the way out Markum comes to collect us with a bunch of guards. We agree and follow him back to his office at town hall. He talks at length about the importance of procedures and legal search demands, we object to theoretically legal racist/bullying tactics and tell him that his procedures need updating, and he eventually reveals his belief that the result of our goblin negotiations should be Yarbknock's death, because (in summary) the only safe goblin is a dead goblin. We conclude that ACAB including Markum.

Our next appointment is with Duvessa in a meeting room with Duvessa, a person with a pen, and some politician.

She apologises for the kerfuffle without offering any solution (aside from making peace with the goblins). She sets up a diplomatic satchel for us.

She's hoping that we'll go to the goblin base and get Yarbknock to agree to travel back to Bryn Shander with us, and we have that invitation and some trade concessions to offer to sweeten the deal.

Also in the satchel is a crystal we can shatter as a beacon for aid (a pair of assault wizards will teleport in to help us). It mightn't work in the moutains themselves.

The third person is the magic using woman, Vellynne, who did the amplification stuff at Easthaven. She's in town for unrelated reasons. We talk about the big problems with cultural ascceptance of a goblin peace, but don't get very far.

We head out around midday to Karkalohk. That afternoon we find a polar bear, who weirdly appears to be meditating. They wake up as we approach. We shout "hello", but it runs off.

We camp off the road, but that's not secret enough to hide from the attack of the Bryn Shander guards who've followed us. There are six "regular" guards (including the troublesome gate guards), and three heavies (including a guy who was hassling the goblin in town).

We spot them as they attack so they don't get to kill us in our beds; they immediately cop spiked growth and scorching rays, and there's a big fight with multiple deafening thunderwaves and many punchings and hammerings. We kill them all, except one veteran -- the ringleader, as far as we can tell -- who tried to run off, but got eaten by a polar bear.

After the fight, the polar bear has disappeared, but there's a goliath standing nearby watching us.
