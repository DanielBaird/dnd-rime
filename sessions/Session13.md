Session 13

We find a sketched symbol on the slavers. It's a weird looking fist with a chain, maybe there's some letters implied in it?
While outside talking with the local cops after the slaver incursion, Lucas gets nailed in the neck with a crossbow bolt and dropped.
Everyone else looks around but can't see the sniper. Rosk produces a goodberry for Lucas and he wakes back up. We don't find anything else and eventually head to bed.
Lucas is poisoned when he wakes, and writes down how the poison feels and other details of the experience, before lay-on-hands-ing the poison away.
We decide to spend a day chasing down slavers before chasing the cauldron more and head to the town hall to ask Markum about it. We find two guards harassing a little guy in a cloak. It's a goblin representative from the goblin king Yarbknock.
We intervene and there's a tussle (Lucas vs the guy who kicked the goblin) but Markum arrives yelling to cut the shit out, and sends the guards away.
Markum sends the goblin inside and tells us the current intel on slavers; it's not rare but he doesn't have a specific known base or organisation we can target. Targos is probably a bit shadier (and slaver friendly) than Bryn Shander.
As we decide to keep chasing the cauldron to Targos, Duvessa comes out and tells us about Yarbknock's negotiations. She asks us to represent Bryn Shander in negotiations at Karkalohk.
Around midday we wrap it up and set off to Targos, getting some frowns from the gate guards (Lucas stops to catch them up on the fact that there might be some goblin envoys around and they should maybe be less racist). We get to Targos just before nightfall.
We head to the Luskan Arms, an tavern built 200 years ago in the traditions of Luskan's City of Sails. There's a chill draught, and some rats and rotten floorboards. Barkeep is fairly tired and worn looking.
There's a few drinkers, but we notice some folk in the corners who are surveiling the room, looking like security or something.
Lucas buys a round and asks after our friend Prue. There's no meaningful response from the barkeep. Lucas asks about the clientele, nodding at the "secret agents", but still no real response.
We decide to dine here and see what happens. What happens is a patron sidles over and tells us we should talk to the speaker and just kind of check in. The speaker is in the tavern, so we head over for a chat.
The speaker, Naerth, asks after our business, we say we're looking for our friend Prue, and also any mercenary work. They say they have work for us; to pursue a rumour of treasure in a sunken ship, foundered off the coast.
He'll go 50/50 on what's in the ship. He has directions to the approximate location, and will keep an eye out for our cauldron.
We agree. Rosk hears rats scrurrying in the night but nothing else; we head off next morning to the north-west.
We notice a frozen herd of reindeer. Lucas investigates and some have biiig bites out of them. We move on.
We camp with a fire, and notice a glow approaching. It's a herd of reindeer, some have glowing antlers. We creep up but they're startled by something -- not us -- and run toward us, swerving to avoid us. We see goliath hunters pursuing them, and one tackles a reindeer. The hunters hike away with their catch.
We decide to catch them up, and do. Lucas tells them we're friends. Rosk asks about a wrecked boat, but we are struggling to be understood. We share our names, the Goliath is called Twisted Limb (he/him). Lucas asks about the frozen herd, they say it's not safe.
We head back to camp and sleep. Next morning the sky looks darker even than usual, so we get our ropes ready for a good ol' blizzard roping-together and head off. We get to the coast and search for a while before Rosk spies the ship in the distance.
We approach over the thick ice. The ship is locked in and sheathed over in ice. We watch carefully for a few minutes and hear loud creaking and gutteral snarls from the ship.
We yell a bit to see if we can get the inhabitants to come out, but nothing emerges, so we scale the bow (Lucas falling and hurting himself) and explore the ship. There's movement and growling below decks.
The captain's cabin at the rear holds a skeleton and a chest. Rosk finds a rat-skull key in the captain's coat. The chest is iced shut; Lucas hammers it a little to open it.
The chest has two halves; one mostly empty with a few wine corks, the other side has treasure -- 150 gp, 2 jewelery 225gp x 2, and a cloth bag with magical darkness inside. Linton reaches in and pulls out, with some effort, a massive direwolf that we now have to fight. Everyone gets a hit in but Lucas spends every luck point all concentrates into a super hard smash that kills it.
We explore the north cabins; they're fairly boring. We find barrels, beds, and some maps (we acquire a lovely pirate-style map of the Sword Coast).
We look down the stairs to the deck below, and find an ice troll there. Lucas and Linton run down the stairs to attack, and hit, but the troll immediately starts to heal its damage.
Pilaf tosses a Chaos Bolt that hits, and Rosk moonbeams, both hitting. It seems oddly undisturbed by the damage.
It bites Lucas who responds with a Searing Smite that finally seems to hurt the troll with damage it doesn't heal.
Our fight continues with us focussing on fire damage and trying to stay clear of the troll's radiating cold as it lumbers up the stairs at the casters.
Rosk's moonbeam and Pilaf's stack of scorching rays hit hard and the thing finally dies. We spend a moment healing up, then notice a frozen crag cat at the other end of the hold, near a thickly frozen pile of treasure.
The ice on the gold is thick, so we decide to deal with it later. We knock on the south door and ask who's in there; there's no answer so Lucas tries to boot the door open, forgetting that the ice troll already tried that.
So we go to the bow instead, exploring the galley and the room ahead. There's a broken picture of a drow inside.
Just then a huge dragon lands on the ship and yells at us. We hide in tghe cabin like bunnies. The dragon talks a lot, addressing it's friend "Malthrond" telling M that it smells intruders and M should get their spells ready. Through the door we hear the dragon get upset at its lackeys letting a troll get on board (it's unclear if Malthrond is also being reprimanded), then leaving.
We find about fifty pieces of kobold and a few litres of kobold juices -- from maybe four individuals -- scattered around the deck. We approach the south door again, which is now open. Inside are some barrels adapted for kobold beds, but no kobolds.
We decide to leave the gold pile and take just what we found in the captain's chest. We avoid the frozen herd which we now suspect is the dragon's larder, and end up back in Targos.
At the Luskan Arms we meet the speaker Naerth and mention that there were more dragons than we expected. He disagrees that half of the retrieved treasure is what we agreed on, and insists that he should be getting half of the total treasure including the dragon gold.
He claims that he knows what we are really after, takes all the treasure we present, and insists that we still owe him. His new proposal is that we kill the goblin king Yarbnock while participating in the coming goblin negotiations. He believes we're required to do the assassination as what we owe, but in return will return the cauldron he knows we're seeking.
We don't trust this fuck, but tell him we agree, and stay that night in the inn.
