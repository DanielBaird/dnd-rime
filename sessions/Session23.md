Session 23

The freed prisoner's name is Mary; she's coming with us.

Based on timing we decide to attempt to save two hours chasing the dragon by cutting over the moutain.

An avalanche hits us. We ride it out, Rosk and Lucas's sled jostles but we stay on; Pilaf and Linton's sled also makes it through but breaks a sled ski. Mary gets caught up by the avalanche and disappears.

Lucas insists on searching for Mary for a bit but he just finds sled wreckage.

We continue toward Easthaven as a blizzard comes up. We decide to keep going at full speed and hope to emerge nearer Easthaven; that pays off and we emerge from the storm within view of E.

E is being attacked by the chardalyn dragon. They've built a few defence towers but only one is still standing. A frazzled guard is telling injured folk to head to the town centre so we head that way.

A building collapses in the fire and Lucas runs in, Lucas and Rosk drag out some townsfolk. Lucas juices the two unconscious folk with lay-on-hands.

We get to city hall; there's wounded folk and piles of corpses. We notice Bartleban the White Lady proprieter is dead.

We find Imdra inside trying to organise a resistance. We recommend evac for non-combatants and messengers to the next towns on the list. She's already doing that, and hasn't seen Verlain or any other magical folk since the attack started, so we all decide to head to the remaining ballista tower and do what we can to fight the construct.

We arrive at the tower. Rosk and Linton climb up to the ballista platform; Pilaf and Lucas run ahead of the tower to intersect the dragon's path as it attacks, planning to thunderstep onto its back.

Linton realises the soldiers operating the ballista are all fresh zombies but shrugs that off. They shoot at the dragon, hit, and it crashes to the ground. Everybody runs toward it aside from Rosk, who order the zombies re-load the ballista.

In the cloud of snow and dirt the dragon construct starts glowing and humming; Lucas keeps running ahead, hoping it's not gonna blow him up.

Pilaf chaos-bolts the glowing thing through the snow. Her force blast clears a tunnel through the cloud to the dragon's head, giving the zombie ballista another shot and also showing us its breath weapon firing back at the tower, and also hitting Lucas in the face.

Lucas jumps on and attaches his harness ropes that he'd been preparing, but the stone dragon leaps into the air and Lucas falls off and nearly dies. We limp back to town hall and let them know the dragon left.

We look through out notes on dragon destinations and reluctantly realise that we'll have to rest for now, then head west through Bryn Shander and Targos, hopefully catching the dragon at Bremen.
