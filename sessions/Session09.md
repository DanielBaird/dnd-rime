Session 9

We agree to help Dzaan with a device in the tower, a rune chamber, that can make illusions real -- he's hoping to turn himself into Real Dzaan.

We check his office and find an whirring clockwork-y amulet that he offers to us in return for our assistance.

We drop down into the room below but once Rosk, Lucas, and Linton are in the room, a basilisk in the room attacks us.

Pilaf drops in and her usually reliable chill touch unaccountably misses, as does Lucass attack. Rosk's Moonbeam hits it but it shakes off Linton's flurry of punches.

The Basilisk's stare starts turning Pilaf to stone, and it's bite lands on Linton, taking him out and turning him into a grey blob person again.

Lucas burns up some spell points and his flaming blazing hammer smashed pretty hard, hurting it a lot and setting it on fire.

Rosk tries a blinding spell but the Basilisk shakes it off, too late to save its life as Rosk's spores and the fire do it in. Pilaf's stone legs turn back into Drow meat.

Pilaf uses her spare potion bottle to collect some basilisk poison.

Dzaan comes down and we head into the corridor and check out an adjoining bedroom. There's a body that we stay away from, until we're just about to head into the Rune Chamber when Rosk can't help but poke the body. He awakens a Wisp that starts throwing electricity around. It's a quick little wisp and dodges attacks for a bit until Linton finally lands some punches. Rosk powers up some spores and those do some damage too. Finally Lucas lands a heavy hit and the wisp vanishes.

Rune Chamber

We enter a room with runes graven on the walls and ceiling that we're standing on. An illusion of a wizardy-boi appears -- upside down and hanging from the old floor, that's now our ceiling -- and says things we don't understand.

Dzaan says he thinks the runes around the chamber are instructions. Pilaf studies the runes and works out how the thing works. She tests it by illusing a trilby and putting it onto the plinth in the room, and invokes the room's magic. It's turns into a real, non-illusory trilby that Linton unaccountably refuses to put on.

We decide to rush into Dzaan's transformation. It seems not to work until Rosk walks over to him and touches him -- at which point there's a massive flash of light and heat and we are all blinded for a few seconds. Dzaan and Crintas have disappeared. A moment later Dzaan re-appears, looking puzzled. Lucas tries to teach him a handshake to test his ability to learn, but he starts to turn into a blob.. We decide to leave the room for a minute or two.

When we head back in, he's fully a blackish blob. Linton pokes at the blob and it starts attacking us; we run away.

The tower sounds weird, and on the way out we notice that sounds are weird, muted and without echo. Long shanks is missing, and once we get out we can see the sky and the sun for the first time in weeks. Sounds are muted, and the sun gives no heat.

We decide to overnight in the tower. Our food doesn't taste of anything, and our fire doesn't warm us. We're all creeped out and decide to go back to the Rune Chamber and work out what's happened.

The ooze that was Dzaan Prime is seeping under the door. Rosk summons spiky growth along the corridor and the ooze eventually drags it way through the spikes to the door of the next room.

We fought the slime and Lucas copped a lot of acid damage including permanent damage to his armour and warhammer before we won.

We went back into the Rune Chamber and tried a bunch of stuff; nothing seemed to work. Pilaf guesses that whatever the disaster was that blob-ified Dzaan has borked the chamber.

We give up and head back to Caer Konig. The sun doesn't move in the sky, and there's no weather. After a day and a half of travel through the frozen world we arrive at CK.

There's no-one around and no forge noises from Frozen Far Expeditions; We head inside and there's nobody there. It's the same everywher else; it's like the people just disappeared. Shit's weird and we don't have much to go on.

Suddenly we hear the toll of a bell; it filled the air like sounds did in the normal world. It's from the North, out of town.
