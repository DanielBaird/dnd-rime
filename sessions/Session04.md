we're standing on frozen ice across the tunnel floor. These tunnels are all very tall -- 50ft river tunnel, 30ft walking tunnels.

a pleasant aroma of stew wafts down the tunnel.

along the tunnel there's a frozen waterfall presenting a 10 foot ice wall.

Linton ki-step-of-the-wind-s to jump to the top of the waterfall and attaches a rope that we all scale. A side tunnel seems to be the source of the food smell.

Up a couple of flights of steps there's a cavern with many carcasses including trout and humanoids. A frost giant skeleton lies encased in ice.

Rosk tries to harvest bone fragments to amke darts, but the skeleton animates and attacks.

We pound the giant skeleton to dust with Rosk's Moonbeam doing a lot of the work.

We choose south at the next fork, go down stairs to a big cavern with a butcher block, chunks of humanoid, and a bubbling pot in the centre tended by an old woman, who turns to us and transforms into a scary hag who attacks us along with her wispy spirit ball.

Pilaf chill touches and hits
Rosk throws fire and hits
Lucas shakes off an attack of terror, runs to her and smashes her into dust
Rosk and Linton continue fighting the spirit ball
Pilaf casts sleep, giving us advantage on it
Rosk casts thunderwave, damaging it
Lucas drops his shield and two-hands his hammer to kill the wisp

We tip out the cauldron, it looks like the fisherfolk are in there.


At the end of the cavern there's a huge frozen pool with four frost giant skeletons bare visible though the ice. There's a few exits from the ice pool cavern, we follow the water source up an small waterfall / cliff and find a smaller tunnel (not ice giant sized -- 10-15 ft wide) cluttered with crap. We head in

It leads to a cavern with some makeshift beds, makeshift armor rack with shitty sword and a helmet, and a bunch of kobold corpses.

two exiting tunnels end in a dead end and toilets; the remaining tunnel leads to a bunch of dead kobold rooms

eventually we find a religious fervour group of 4 kobolds chanting to a super kobold with a frosty white blaze down his face and body

next to Leader is an advisor with a tally slate

Linton thought this leader might be a threat to the towns and maybe be under control of the frost maiden

Lucas holy-weapons his hammer and we all bust in
Linton pounds someone to death
Pilaf sleeps the little guys
kobold adviser throws a wasp grenade
rosk attempts to entangle them in sudden brambles
dragonshield leader runs through the brambles and spears lucas
lucas misses
pilaf's chill touch misses
linton punches the wasp swarm
advisor slings a rock that linton catches
wasps sting Linton again
Linton's down, Lucas is surprised to see Linton blip into a pale grey humanoid
Rosk blinds the dragonshield
dragonshield frost-breaths the wrong way and freezes an unconscious kobold, then recovers from blindness
Lucas hits, finally
pilaf chill-touches dragonshield
kobold spears Lucas again
lucas pounds k again
pilaf chills but misses
advisor is prepping something
rosk goodberry's grey-blob-Linton who comes alive; grey-blob-Linton is embarassed
kobold misses lucas
lucas hammers kobold
pilaf frosts the assistant who dies
rosk bites the dragonshield on the shoulder
ds hits lucas (that's three) but embeds his spear in the ground
lucas misses ds
linton flails
ds can't pull his spear
lucas hits again
linton punches ds to death

lucas leaps onto linton with a dagger and demands answers
