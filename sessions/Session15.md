Session 15

Actually it's only kinda a goliath; it's a goliath werebear. The Thornleaf brothers remember a tale of a goliath werebear Oyaminartok, that roams the dale.

Rosk says hi. it replies, "Greetings scaled skin one."

It's rare to see sucha diverse group, especially one that rankles the guards so.

I'm aware of your activities in the Dale. I've also heard stories of the constabulary. So my actions just now were not hard to choose."

Linton asks about goblin peace; she talks about a balance to nature, her preference is for less bloody options.

Linton: why following us?

- I followed the guards, and found you.

Linton: can you guide us?

- I think I can offer you some guidance.

We finish our long rest under the watchful eye of O.

Next day we see a shooting star and O says it's a good omen. We make good time with O's guidance.

We ask about the Duergar:
- dunno their plan, duergar activity is increasing over last 18mths. They're interested in chardalyn (the crystal) which is corrupting to the mind.
- There's a cave to the NE (NNE Of Kelvin's) where a band of corrupted mortals live in a cave probably full of chardaly (We can nav there if we need to).
- We remember the cult with chardalyn amulets, our amulet is depleted of its evil.
- She doesn't know much more about the white lady ghost.

Second night, O takes watch again. In the middle of the night we start awake.

We all experience the same dream, as a single individual:
- dark unfamiliar cavernous room
- a tunnel extends forward to a right turn
- we walk to turn to find a bigger, opulent throneroom cavern with pillars, throne etc
- treasure and bodies are strewn along the sides of the room
- a sleeping beholder floats in the center of the room
- we/I approach the beholder on tiptoes
- the B awakens when we're 20 feet away and stares around the room looking for what woke it up
- we awaken

O says she's never seen or heard of a beholder.

Lucas asks about the awakened animals we've come across. O says it's a frost druid tactic to defend nature against... capitalism or something?

We reluctantly get breakfast started. O says we'll arrive that day. Lucas invites her to come along but she declines.

Around midday we notice a herd of white elk approaching; all except one notice us and startle away.

Linton sneaks up on the elk. At around 10 ft his head jerks up and sares, then charges. O steps in and starts a conversation with the (apparently awakened) elk, who says their protecting the herd from the dirty bipeds. O sends them on their way.

We have another philosophical reflection on the ethical ramifications of awakening creatures and not providing them a supportive social structure.

Later we arrive at the goblin city entrance, and O says goodbye and runs off (including occasional belly slides) in polar bear form.

We meet Izobai at the gate and he leads us into the fortress.

a Warg shakes its rider and attacks us, but before it arrives the rider yells "halt" and it drops the the ground.

Izobai points out to us that the fat, bad warg trainer wouldn't exist in the good old days.

We see the Shield Guardian golem we heard about before.
We meet yarbknock (the ever-gnawing) who has a mechanical jaw.
There's various goblins in his retinue.

"Greetings, I see you are here in response to my message."
Linton: we're here representing Speaker Shane and Bryn Shander.

"Excellent, our economy is under more pressure every day. Come to a dinner tonight."

Izobai: lol ""economy"". Anyway i've been told you can explore and talk to folk, to FoStEr ThE iNtErAcTiOnS between our cUlTuReS.

Maybe speak to Manifect the healer to get a good perspective.

We decide sure let's do that and make our way to the collection of tents in the hospital area. Manifect is busy rattling some bones in some kind of ritual that she interrupts and invites us in.

Izobai said we should talk to you about yarbknock's plans for the future?
- you've met Yk, you can see the probem
- I forsaw a smarter bunch that you..
- (she claims that he is a gnome in disguise, as evidenced by her seer abilities)
- I've seen what happens if yk stays in power

= how did yk rise to power?
- slowly working his way up through the ranks
- it was fine before the rime, but now yk's policies are a bad idea, esp according to her visions of the future
- if yk stays king, someone will replace him soon and make things worse
= how are goblin kings normally selected?
- combat challenges
- death of the previous king, then a sort of dirty election
- yk is protecting his secret more and more by throwing goblins over the cliff when they get close to the truth

We go talk to Izobai.
- when you do it, you can trust the dinner guards are on my side
- yes there'll be some bloody action afterward as I assume kingship
- I'll have to charge you as kingslayers but then you just win the trial by combat, against like a couple of bears or whatever, and you're sweet
- I can't just challenge him, because his supporters won't transfer to me. If you kill him, they probably will
- Whadda you mean he's a gnome

The dinner bell rings and we head in to the hall with Izobai. We're patted down and relinquish out weapons, but Iz pushes a dagger secretly into the Rosk's jacket.

During dinner we ask Yk what's the main goal of this deal.
- more stability, economy better off
- everyone better off
-

We can't decide on a good course of action and the dinner passes. Afterward we go into yk's room.

He immediately turns to us, takes off his helmet, and is obviously a gnome.

Spellix Romwod the gnome was in a caravan caught in an avalanche and everyone else was captured by goblins. Spellix followed secretly, built a goblin costume, and used it to help his friends escape.

His mechanical jaw malfunctioned hence the name. He failed to help his old friends, kinda started caring about the goblins and started an ambitious plan to help them including building Karkalok.

He's in too deep and has run out of ideas to keep the goblins aligned and under control. Now he'd just be happy to escape with his life.

- izobai - we can take yk away and you can run the place
- okay but you gotta hit bears first
- Lucas: what about you and i have a duel instead?
- izobai [cowardly]: um no it's okay bears it is
- us: fine

(Bryan said actually Yk tried to avoid the immeidate pit fight)

we fight two polar bears, then a third they release, then a big blobby flesh blob that acids people and captures the thornleafs in its tentacles.
