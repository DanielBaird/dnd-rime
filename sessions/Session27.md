We rush downstairs to find guards who are muttering about the tentacled horror they're encountering.

We bust out into the prison courtyard and see teh Drow priestess's cell busted open, a tantacle blob creature fighting guards, and hear Gantt begging for his life.

We rush toward Gantt and see the Drow Priestess talking to him from outside his cell. He's afraid of her.

Linton calls out to her, and Rosk summons lightning down. She transforms into another of the tentacle creatures.

The first tentaboi comes toward us but transforms into a spider and scales a wall near us and spits out a web of sticky fluid.

Lucas pulls free, scrambles away from the web, and blasts the beast off the wall with a eldrich blast. "Don't ask!" he yells.

missed some stuff...

Pilaf is addressed by the priestess.
(insert monologue here)
She is compelled to hand over some secret item to the priestess.

Lucas dives back into the web, getting stuck, and pounding the spider tentacle creature.

Pilaf runs over toward Gantt's cell, hands over her secret book, and the priestess disappears, taking Gantt with her. All the remaining blob creatures disappear.

We dick around with Perry's magic notebook for a while. It doesn't burn, it's un-stabbable, and it's a conduit for influence from *someone*.

Eventually Linton tries tearing it in half with his magical punch arms. That works, and there's a chill wind and the faint sound of screams. Now when we try burning the two halves, it works, and there's abunch of faint screams as it burns.

Theat night Pilaf dreams of Vaelish Gantt, tied in a chair or suffering in various other ways. He's saying "there's an island".. "I don't know, I swear I don't know".. "one of the Brotherhood had a orb, I don't know how it knows"..

So we guess there's an island or something?

On the journey back south, we find the wreckage of the decoy prison transport we sent out. Then we get to Termalaine.

It's 70% wrecked and almost completely evacuated. We find a trapdoor into the tunnels that connected the Eastside rooms, and find someone calling faintly from a room.

We dig through the debris and find Marta, her father Clyde, and couple of other folk blocked into a room. They're very happy that we were able to free them, and we bring these refugees with us down to BS.

We check in with Duvessa, she's been sleeping in her office and we wake her (and Lucas heals her for 5 HP). We catch her up on what happened at Revel's End. Lucas writes a door sign for her saying "important meeting, do not disturb" and on teh way out Pilaf casts Sleep to help her get some rest.

Lucas rolls to fall in love and gets a 20 so he slightly falls in love with Duvessa.

She tells us that Velynne and info about islands and orbs will all be in the archive on a lower floor of the town hall.

We find Verlynne there, she's got Secret History of the Ten Towns, and Mysteries of the Sea of Moving Ice on the desk next to her and is reading from a third book.

She asks what we found out. We mention an island and she paws through books to find the Mysteries-Sea-Ice one. SHe tells us that Auril's legendary base could be an island in the sea, but there's no indication of if it really exists or how to find it.

There are stories of a sentient whale who acts as an oracle for those lost?

We mention the orb and she scowls. "What'd he say exactly?" She's not happy to hear that someone has a orb and seems to think it's sign of treachery in the Brotherhood.

Professor Orbs are smooth grapefruit sized spheres of quartz, pricks of light deep inside. They're sentient scholars with extensive knowledge in four subjects.

Professor Skant has been in her family for generations, one of Skant's areas was history of Netheril, the civilisation that the flying city belonged to.

A Brotherhood member stole Skant a while ago; if Vaelish knows about it then that indicates a consiracy within the Brotherhood.

We've met a sentient sea creature expert before in Bremen, so decide to go talk to them about finding the magic whale.

We overnight at the Northlook, telling the story of the Jarlmoot that we fought a storm giant or something.

Next day we head past Targos toward Bremen, and meet the slaver we bought all the slaves from a while back. They're carrying Dredivex and a squidling in their slave cages.

We haggle a bit to buy Dredivex and the kid, the main goal is to build some trust with this guy so it's easier to kill him later. The group notices the gate guards noticing the gold changing hands and we think this guy is up for a robbing tonight.

After a short period of pretending to be slaves while we head away from the gate, Dredivex and the kid head off back to BS.

We get to Bremen and find a crowd of people outside the five tavern area. Punky Brewster's caravan is here and the crowd is all drinking. The brewers are asking for ratings and tallying the most popular brew.

Two of the brothers are sitting at a table at their partially constructed new super-tavern looking grumpy about stuff.

Lucas can't bring the grumpiest one around to see this as as opportunity, but Rosk has better luck with the second one.

We find Tali, still alive and ready to chat. Tali fills us in on their guesses about the whale.

There's said to be a dock with a bell somewhere on the coast (guessing at a location). The bell summons a creature which might be the whale? That's our next destination.
