Session 18

We reluctantly accept the Rime's darkness into our hearts, and head out for the chardalyn cave.

We come across tracks of goliaths. Around midday we find a herd of goats. As we pass the herd we see one of them turns humanoid, and two of the goats charge toward us.

Goats hit Lucas and Linton but bounce off armour. The homanoid throws an exploding snowball at us and the halflings take a lot of damage.

We fight the goats and their druid guardians

Then we find the chardalyn cave. Tracks show up to four beserkers have recently come and gone from the cave.

We follow the raised path to the crude stone mouth fashioned around the entrance. We ascend a ramp to a cavern with two cells, in each there's a halfling-sized blue egg that looks hatched.

Pilaf and Lucas can't work out what kind of egg it is.

We head south to a smaller cave with a stinky bloody hole leading downward in the corner. There's a pile of stuff against the wall. It's a loose assortment of sundries -- low value coins, cracked spyglass, etc. A white dragon wyrmling drops from the ceiling as Lucas looks through the stuff and bites him.

Rosk bite back, Linton pounds it, and it's sibling appears. We weather a few frost breaths and Lucas nearly feezes to death, but we kill the two wyrmlings.

Lucas finds a +1 golden warhammer, awesome.

We explore the other exit from the main cavern, Rosk feels a compulsion to take the left fork. We find a sort of chapel to Auril, containing a brazier with blueish smoke that billows into an Auril shape. Rosk describes that this brazier is as a reward Auril grants to selected followers, and tells us his story about being an Auril adherent and the mark on his face? signifying that. He doesn't understand the Rime or what Auril's intention is.

A goliath beserker charges in, cops some hits, but rushes to the brazier and mumbles a sort of prayer or something.

We kill him but he comes back to life to knock Lucas down and fight a bit more. Once he's down again properly, Rosk revives Lucas with goodberries.

We rest of a bit and heal up, then continue along another tunnel. a plank spans a 10ft chasm, on the other side there's some sleeping pallets. Another chasm stops us and we turn back.

Another cavern has butchering stuff and bits of carcasses. Adjoining is a snowy larder with meat stored.

We've done the whole cave and no other residents. We figure we can ambush the folk who are out, but they're arriving home as we come out of the slaughter cave.

Rosk conjures spike growth that the two arriving beserkers charge through to attack. We pound at them and they both die and pop back up a few times, and Lucas goes down again. Rosk revives him with a berry and he sprints down the corridor to the brazier.

Rosk blinds a beserker which seems like a good idea. Lucas arrives at the brazier and smashes it with the gold warhammer. It blows up and the spirit of Auril leaves it and flies off down the tunnel.
