# Session 3

Actually it was a magical Liopleurodon.

We travel from Bremen to Bryn Shander, arriving to a closed gate.
Lucas pounds on the gate with his hammer, perhaps a bit more heavily then intended.

The guards arrive and ask who's there. Lucas convinces them that we know the Speaker and they should therefore let us in.

Northlook proprieter is Scramsax, who had heard about the wizard but not the missing Garet. We tipped a silver coin.

Lucas is using "Finnegan" as his alias almost all the time.

That night Pilaf heard a scraping in the corridor, it was a Drow assassin trying to get into Lucas' room. She yelled everyone awake as the Drow kicked in the door.  He hit at Lucas and hurt him a lot. The group rushed in and pounded the assassin as he ran for the window to escape. Most attacks missed but a ray of frost caught him hard, and on realising that he was outnumbered he stabbed himself to death.

Marcus and the guard come by to collect the body. We talk to Danica about chingwa and if anyone was asking after any of us, give Scramsax a silver for the damaged window and ask him about dog sleds.

Sleds aren't available; we hoof it toward Easthaven. It's a two day journey; a blizzard on day 2 separates Pilaf and Linton from the group. While searching for them we ran into the Bryn Shander sacrifice; he was necromanced

Easthaven

no walls
founded by anti-thieves-guild folk
pickpocketing is legal in the town

We arrive too late to save the wizard being burned

Imdra al'Lagazth, capt'n of E-h militia
- Dzaan the human wizard
- did a pay'n'slay on some adventurers
- hired them as bodyguards, murdered them
- not sure why
- this happened months ago
- maybe was evil for years, maybe turned bad recently
- hid via illusion magic, got found out

Imdra quickly changes topic to missing fisherfolk
- 4 went missing
- on the Lak Dinshire
- the "town" wants us to look for them
- their 4-person boat never returned
- was while the wizard was in custody
- it's not compensation, but i do have these two things that were Dzaan's maybe you might want one:
  - a presumably magical wizard's bag
  - a presumably magical wizard's copper tube

Imdra really put on the pressure for us to immediately steal a boat and go looking, but eventually pointed us to the White Lady Inn. Instead of going there though, we steal a random boat and head to the area Imdra described.

We find a rowboat bobbing alongside a cliff (the Bunch of Knuckleheads, the missing boat) near some caves.
- one cave at water level
- other caves higher
