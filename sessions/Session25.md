Session 25

We've defeated the Duregar invaders and head to the gate to support the tower defence.

The gate guards are stopping a small group of people who are trying to leave, including Keegan, Garret and Boy.

We're gestured through, Lucas grabs Keegan and Garret and pulls them through with us; they head away.

There's one ballista tower and a couple of smaller towers with mages aboard.

The guard chief at the tower is an arrogant jerk so we head to the wall to assume defensive positions.

The dragon arrives, cops a big fireball from a mage, and diverts to attack the mages. The mage shield deflects the breath weapon but that hits the ballista tower.

We realise the ballista itself is still okay and rush to fire it at the dragon. We hit and the dragon crashes dead into the frozen lake. The mages head over to recover the body, like a SHIELD operation.

Luncas does some shit stirring and starts some anti-Naerth rumours, "A Speaker should speak for the whole town".

We head back to BS. We catch up with the inn-keeping brothers and other folk from Bremen. We shit-stir with the Bremen refugees a bit about how Naerth was willing to take support from us and the Arcane brotherhood, but weren't willing to offer suport to any refugees.

We enter BS quietly as refugees and arrive at the Northlook. It's packed. Scramsax and another person are serving. We don't see Wublick the undergnome but his devices are in use -- a barrel tap device, a spit rotating device, etc.

S is happy to see us alive and offers a single room for us to share. He mentions that Wublick has also upgraded security, and shows us his new vegemite product.

Lucas and Linton talk about what Lucas is gonna say to their dad. Linton writes Lenrich a letter saying he's never coming back home. Lucas keeps that letter but decides he'll send a letter to Lenrich saying he hasn't found Linton yet.

That night Pilaf hears someone fiddling at the door. She asks who it is, and they whisper back "it's Verlain".

Pilaf wakes the rest of us and pops to door open, but unfortunately forgets about the security alarm which blares out.

Verlain leaps under the bed and stays hidden as we apologise to everyone we woke. It's not the first time a door alarm has accidently gone off.

Once the dust settles we get to talking. Verlain has a lead on the book/spell she wanted us to find. An Arcane Brotherhood member, Vaelish Gant, held prisoner in Revel's End (prisoner 237) for seditious actions against civilisation -- he tried to overthrow Duvessa via spell power and other illegal means -- has information.

He's a wizard so won't have spells without his spellbook. Verlain says we can even kill him after we get his information, if we think that'll work (and suggests if we do, we should bring her his head for further interrogation).

Next morning we talk to Duvessa. She super tired. She reveals that Naerth has handed our cauldron over the the speaker council to feed the refugees at BS.

Linton asks that we get permission to speak to Vaelish at Revel's End, implying that we're going to interrogate him perhaps a little roughly.

Prudence and another zentaran spy are being taken to Revel's End, so we could accompany that caravan if we like.
