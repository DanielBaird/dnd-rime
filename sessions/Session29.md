We emerge from the crone tunnel and meet Sopo outside. He's a little surprised to see us.

We wonder what to do and Sopo suggests a secret entrance to the cultist fortress. We decide that's the go.

There are a lot of cave entrances; Sopo leads us to a bunch of four and points at the good one (at least he thinks this is the one he is thinking of).

He has no other advice, so we head in. The tunnel looks like it has been travelled through -- no by humanoids -- and soon opens up into a cave that stinks of yetis.

We back out quietly and check with Sopo. He appears confused between left and right, so we switch to the mirror-opposite tunnel entrance.

We choose directions away from the last yeti cave, and find a small cave with mirrored ice pillars and some yeti nests. We opt to follow the tunnel past, but don't sneak good and we have to kill a couple of yetis.

Turns out all the tunnels in this area are dead ends, so eventually we head back to the original tunnel and enter the yeti smelling cave.

Lucas fails stealth pretty badly and the two sleeping yetis wake up. Luckily Pilaf had a fireball ready, but it catches Lucas pretty hard.

A third yeti comes into the cave and we have to kill them all.

Turns out all the four tunnels are just empty yeti holes. We're pretty upset with Sopo and while arguing he mentions that the map he's trying to remember is in the Garden of Death. Eventually we realise that it's called that because it's full of statues of Auril's enemies, vs we die if we go there. So we decide to go have a look.

The garden is ringed with icy walls with some broken down gaps. There's big ice trees, and scattered frozen "bodies" -- animals, humanoids including some cultists. A mausoleum building is in the centre of the garden.

We head in and immediately fight an ice troll who is roaming the grounds. Trolls have regeneration, and when we kill this one Pilaf collects its heart, which Lucas eats to gain 5 hp of regeneration each turn, aside from fire or acid damage, for 24 hours.

Sopo is over at the mausoleum and urges us inside. Linton checks for magic and doesn't detect any. Lucas barges the door open, revealing a decrepit mausoleum with an empty plinth and a blank back wall. Linton detects magic on the back wall.

We can't work out how to activate the magic; Linton tries walking right at the wall, Platform 9 3/4 style, hurting his nose.

Sopo claims the map is visible right on the wall. We notice runes in the corners, and when Rosk approaches the wall, a map shimmers into place.

We remember that Rosk was previously in the Auril cult.
