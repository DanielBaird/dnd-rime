Session 17

We decide to head back to BS and see what's happened there.

We arrive in BS midday on the second day and find the SW gate. The gate guards send us to the town hall where we meet Duvessa and join her, Markum, that mage person, and some other folk in a meeting room.

D: So, turns out YK is a gnome
Markum: see I told you goblins can't be trusted
D: We're still gonna try. Adventurers, what's the situation at the goblin town?
Us: izobai is probably less trustworthy than yk would have been.

We decide to do a supply run the the Black Cabin, and see if we can find the chardalyn Crazy Person Cave afterward. So we visit Cobberknocker to get the supplies. He's happy to see us and gets usequipped with an extra pack of rations for Macreedus.

North to Termalaine, arrive at sunset that evening.

T is lovely looking, with green woods beyond and the first large body of liquid water we've seen lapping at the shore.

We feel a bitingly cold gust of wind as we arrive, this is T's iconic Winter Gale, due to the town's position around the Cairn.

We hit up the Blue Clam tavern. Barkeep is a half-orc. Linton goes to order drinks and dinner; drinks are on the house apparently, the barkeep, Vernon, has recognised us based on (hopefully) good
stories about us. Dinner is a spicy chowder.

It's tough everywhere but T wasn't as affected by the downturn as some other towns.

There used to be mining for various gems around. Mostly gone off since the Rime. We could find one by following the eastern edge of the forest. They're generally abandoned, who knows who's living there now -- bears, nomads, whatever. He hasn't heard of our particular group of chardalyn'd folk though.

The trip to Lonelywood is fine, but we should note that past that, the forest goes right to the lake edge.

We sit down for dinner but before it comes, Prue and a couple of big bruisers arrive. She claims to want to remind us of our debts, but Linton objects vigorously, Lucas powers up Linton and then Vernon with Shield of Faith and she backs off.

Dinner goes well and Vernon tells us about the Eastside inn, now run by Marta who took over from her elderly bedridden dad.

We head to the Eastside and find Marta at the front desk. She recognises us, like Vernon did, and is nice. We opt for a single room and end up in a two story (ground & cellar) accessed by a tunnel, and post watch.

Lucas hears footsteps that night but not coming toward our cabin.

Next day we head NE from Termalaine, along the eastern edge of the forest. That day we hear a rattle of metal and a guy steps out from behind a tree and demands our stuff. Two more guys step out from behind other trees.

We don't feel like killing these desperate folk so Linton tosses some coins into the snow and we let them scabble the coins up and run off.

Our beeping device starts going as we travel, and gets stronger as we approach. We realise the

That evening we get to the Black Cabin. It's just as we remember from our dreams -- rotting stilts, sagging roofs.

We dodge a broken stair, and get to the main room. It's just as we remember, and Rosk takes the Amulet of Health.

We explore, and find wine barrels, a small clay figure, and a scroll that says:

"Macreadus,

I've had enough of this damned, relentless cold. I feel it creep into my bones, my head, my heart. I'm heading back to Ten-Towns for a decent meal and a warm bed. I fear this endless winter has numbed your mind, and any tinkerer worth their chains can see the Summer Star is a fool's errand. Maybe without me here to incessantly complain to, you'll finally snap out of your obsession.

If you truly insist on dedicating your remaining days to this doomed project, might I suggest that three is better than two. I considered telling you before, but you were particularly rude about the dinner I made last night.

May the light of the Morninglord protect you,

Copper"

We examine the Summer Star, there's a crystal at the centre which we determine is the psi crystal we need. We talk about collecting vs activating.

We decide to have a go activating the Star. Linton did it in the dream, so decides to try it again. Lucas hikes a mile away to be the healer backup. This time it works out pretty good, and a dome of good weather grows above the cabin, pushing back the Rime.

Linton (and Pilaf, to a lesser extent) start really hurting as the device amps up. Eventually Linton puts the device down and steps back, but he still takes some psychic damage.

Linton decides to turn it off, but isn't sure how. He tries to grab a spinning ring with an astral hand. It works, in the sense that the thing destroys itself and shakes apart, but no-one is hurt. Lucas, a hill away, notices the box stop beeping.

Lucas hikes back and finds everyone. The crystal isn't triggering the box and Linton and Pilaf both feel like it's not as alive as before.

It seems done for but we figure we should take the device's parts and the dead crystal with us anyway, along with some documentation. We all get inspiration.

We stay at the lodge that night under the first starry night sky we've seen since arriving.

On watch, Linton notices a aurora to the west, and watches a dark front sweep over the clear area above us.
